If these views of the general question be correct, our new relations with England will demand a new line of policy at Washington. If England refuses to surrender her quasi colonies and sinister colonization schemes in Central America, it will devolve upon our Cabinet to cut loose from all entangling alliances with her, including the abrogation of the Clayton-Bulwer, the Dallas-Clarendon, and all other joint stock treaty stipulations or projects upon Central American affairs. The anticipated opening of all the bays, ports, inlets and rivers of China to the commerce of the world, has, it may be readily imagined, suggested to the sagacious mind of Palmerston the immeasurable importance that will follow to all the transit routes of the American Isthmus, from the increased prospective commerce between the Pacific and the Atlantic oceans. Hence, in the great movement of England and France for the commercial liberation of the mighty Ghinee empire, we may detect the true causes for this otherwise perplexing rejection by Palmerston of the amended Dallas-Clarendon treaty. It is but the reaction of England’s policy in the East upon her policy and interests in the West.
The confidence, however, with which Lord Palmerston contemplates the elections to the new House of Commons may be carried too far. This new House will prove to be, no doubt, a more strongly commercial body than the last, and more alive to the commercial necessities of “a happy accord” between England and the United States upon all international questions. Let our Cabinet take a bold, independent and decisive stand upon Central American affairs, and Palmerston will very soon be brought to comprehend that the late English elections turned upon the question of a wholesome chastisement of the Chinese, and not upon his personal accounts with the Cabinet at Washington.
