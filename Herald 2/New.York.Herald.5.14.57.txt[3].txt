Such are the reflections suggested by this sublime new Kansas programme of Governor Walker. It is a scheme full of the promises and elements of success. Like Henry Clay, we may now rejoice at the glorious future which opens before us-like Logan, we can “rejoice at the beams of peace;” with every patriotic philosopher in the country, we can now feel that the “darkest hour is just before the break of day,” and that the day, contrary to the usual order of things, is breaking in the West. Mr. Stanton may issue his manifestoes; Mr. Walker may amuse our small beer democratic politicians at the Astor House with his facetious generalities for Buncombe about “popular rights,” and “popular sovereignty,” and “a popular vote upon the Kansas constitution,” and what not; but with this peep of ours behind the curtain we prefer to give our readers the substance, and not the shadow, of his mission to Kansas. He does not go there for nothing.
In conclusion, we are willing to let the current of events in Kansas in the interim to the meeting of Congress, and the developments which will be made after the meeting of Congress, speak for us and for Mr. Walker. His plan is reasonable, feasible, and exceedingly attractive. We know of no scheme better adapted to satisfy all parties in Kansas, to pacify both sections of the Union, or better calculated to carry the prime mover into the White House by popular acclamation. What say our brethren of the South! Let us hear.
