Gov. King is determined we shall not be restricted to mere hearsay evidence of the merit of the system. He wants to try it himself. He begins with a poor place-some small parish in Richmond county-and administers its affairs. If he succeeds here, he will improve. Next thing will be a telegraph from Gov. King to his faithful Stranahan, Nye, Draper & Co., directing them how to manage the affairs of this city. The principle once established, the practice will of course be vigourous, and as the police will be much more efficient for party purposes here than in the country parishes, the interference will naturally be most conspicuous here. Nor is there any reason to doubt but the policy of centralization once entered upon will be steadily pursued until our municipal liberties are as low as those of modern France.
