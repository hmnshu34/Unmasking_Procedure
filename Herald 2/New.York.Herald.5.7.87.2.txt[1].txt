It really appears as if the Boston people had become so far sunken in filth that they never could emerge from it. For the past six weeks the journals of that city have been crowded with the most disgusting details of crime-details which the press of no other city would dare to publish. First, the Kalloch case-then the Dalton divorces suit-then two or three trials for rape-every nasty development being carefully retained for the delectation of the family circle, and each case going beyond the other in beastliness, each paper rivalling the other in hunting up new and “rich” evidence in and out of court; and now the scenes of the court, the brothel, the prison and the hospital are reproduced wish every attention to scenery and costumes upon the stage of the “lofty Academic.” The immoral drama is brought forward just as the public appetite is becoming satiated with the drama of real life and the actress fans the living flame. 
We have no doubt that there is still some of the old Puritan spirit left in Boston, and that the well read and well bred people of that city look upon these occurrences with the disgust which they must excite in the minds of every good man and woman. But the record still shows that the majority inclines towards the nasty stuff which is served up by the journals and the actors. THe senses now going on in Boston remind us of the ancient days when woman of the town were chosen as the representatives of the goddesses-when the Aspasins and Messalinas ruled mighty empires-when the fascinations of Luis were more popular and more profitable than the eloquence of Demosthenes. We should not be surprised to see the farce of the Reign of Terror reenacted, with a slight change in the cast. Instead of a strumpet borne in procession as the Goddess of Reason, the Bostonians would exalt a third rate actress, who finds her fame and dollars in representing the follies and vices of the lowest of her sex, as the type of all that is pure and noble in one of the highest of the arts.
