The west side of Broadway, between Canal and Eighth streets, is also suffering from a tremendous pressure of crinoline. The hoops are more extensive than ever-altogether ungovernable and ungroundable. The treffer is even more impassable than the carriage way, and a fashionably dressed lady takes up quite as much space as an omnibus. Near the hotels you may see crowds of fashionable and unfashionable loafers from all parts of the world, while the mixed crowd of promenaders affords the most interesting study to the philosopher and the philanthropist. The dry goods shops are the greatest gainers by the pressure. In old times the Indies were bears-now they are bulls. They formerly fitted from shop to shop endeavoring to but at the lowest possible rate; now, they all seem anxious to pay the highest prices for everything. The quality of the article is not considered; the only question is, what  did it cost? The American female mind runs chiefly to spending. Who would think that the husbands of these ladies who wear thousand dollar dresses and wipe their “dear” little noses with hundred dollar pocket handkerchiefs, were shinning about Wall street, borrowing money at three per cent a month, or pulling a long face and telling their creditors that they haven't a cent in the world!
The pressure next extends to the theatres, the Opera, and all places of public amusement, which are nightly crowded, the faces of a majority of the audiences being unfamiliar to the kabizte. The society people proper have not all returned to town, but the floating population quite makes up for their absence. The months of September and October make the most pleasant season of the year in New York, and the loungers are enjoying it to the fall. There is no panic among them, except a nervous anxiety caused by fear that someone will spend more money and make more show than they do.
