That that influence will continue to be exerted for the good of society, and in the interest of sound morals, the course of the press in the case of the present District Attorney Hall abundantly proves. This gentleman is a politician, and has political partisans; he is also an amiable, kindly intentioned man, and has strong personal friends in every profession. Yet without exception the city press denounced his course on the Burdell trial; his partisans and friends being even more severe upon him than opponents. Not a single journal has volunteered to defend him, or even abstain from attacking him. 
Such a manifestation of independence does the highest credit to the metropolitan press, and abundantly justifies their claim to the commanding position they occupy.
