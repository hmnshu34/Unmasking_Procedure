	Some of our City journals, we regret to per-ceive, persist in the mistaked notions and counsels which our present commercial troubles ought long since to have exploded. Months ago, when, to every observant eye, the skies were red with un-mistakable portents of a coming storm, they in-sisted that all was as it should be if only the croak-ers and prophets of evil could be silenced. They virtually urged and stimulated the Banks to keep up and even extend their discount lines, insisting that nothing was wanted but confidence, even while our Imports heavily overbalanced our Exports, though the former included Two Millions of Specie per week. But, when these confidence-men had had full swing for three or four months, the sound Banks found themselves absolutely compelled either to contract their discounts or suspend specie payments. They chose that which, where prac-ticable, is the only honest course; and were there-upon assailed for the suddenness and severity of the contraction by those who had done their ut-most to force them to this course by opposing a seasonably and more gradual curtailment. And now these same prophesiers of smooth things would have the Banks expand again and “make things pleasant,” under the assurance that the danger is over and the necessity for caution and strin-gency has passed away.
	We dissent from this view most emphatically. We trust, indeed, that the danger of a general bankruptcy, if such ever existed, is past. We have no fears of a general suspension of specie payments, though some banks as well as merchants whose affairs are not in a satisfactory state will doubtless yet be forced into liquidation. But to im-agine the crisis over, in such a sense as would jus-tify the Banks in discarding their defensive move-ments and increasing their discounts, is utterly to mistake and belittle the trials through which we are now passing.
