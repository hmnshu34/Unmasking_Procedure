	--It may seem unwise to suggest an addition to the number of the philanthropic associations which aspire to a National character and interest, when their number is now generally esteemed too great; and yet we cannot refrain from urging the forma-tion of another, whose express object shall be the preservation and protection of the Aboriginal tribes, or remnants of tribes, still lingering on our soil. Who doubts that the general treatment ex-perienced by those tribes at our hands has been in-consistent with the religion we profess and the reputation we would have the world accord to us? Who will calmly contend that the expulsion or ex-termination which the “Indians” so uniformly experience at our hands is either necessary or just? That it is not necessary, is proved by the example of the Hispano-Americans southward, and of the British-Americans northward, from our territory. That it is not just, the heart of every Christian must painfully attest. 
	We are no dreaming rhapsodists with respect to Indian character or Indian life. The uncivilized Aborigines of America are at best barbarians, usually savages; and savage life is in the main coarse, needy, cruel and wretched. Some virtues inhere in the savage character which are denied to what now passes for civilized society. The Indian, it is deplorably true, will scalp the wife and chil-dren of his enemy; but he rarely eats up his neigh-bor’s farm by usury, or turns a widow and orphans out of doors because they cannot pay their rent. He is remorseless to his for, but seldom ungrateful to his benefactor. He has done many deeds at which Humanity revolts; but when his extermina-tion shall have been accomplished, his destroyers will mournfully recall his nobler qualities and better impulses, and sigh that a race evincing such ca-pacities has been utterly swept from the earth.
