	A spirited discussion has lately sprung up in cer-tain journals with regard to the justice and policy of the weekly publication of the new bankrupts throughout the United States and Canada, which was initiated by The Independent some year or two ago. We most earnestly trust that this publication may be continued and perfected. That it has done and is doing great good, we feel assured; and the fact that the exposed squirm under it strengthens the argument in favor of publishing. Hitherto, bankruptcy has been the easiest and quickest mode of masking money known to this dashing, go-ahead country. To bore half a dozen neighbors of re-spectable standing but easy virtue into writing let-ters of recommendation which suppress a great deal more pertinent truth than they tell--represent your-self as the owner of $5,000 to $20,000 worth of available property--run into debt $500 at this tore, $1,000at that and $300 at the next, until you have for together $25,000 worth of other men's property--sell out rapidly at almost any price for cash, and transfer the unsold residue to an accomplice--now fail, and offer your creditors 20, 25, 0r 30 cents on the dollar, with the cheering assurance that, if they don't snap at it without hesitation or inquiry, and be thankful to do so well, they will get nothing--this is the way thousands have made the money on which they set up as land-speculators and men of property, being enabled to look down with contempt on those who pursue the ways of patient, delving industry or cautious, frugal trade.
