	Les us once more, at the risk of being incursive, urge the farmers everywhere to plant and sow to the extent of their ability. It were better, of course, to have been able to plant earlier; there is no doubt a risk of frost in planting corn in June; but better a risk of frost in than the certainty of no harvest at all. Indian corn, on rich, warm land, often matures within a hundred days--that is to say, between the 10th of June and the 20th of Sep-tember, which is as early as we need anticipate a killing frost unless in some Northern valleys. Car-rots, Ruta-Bagas and Beets, yielding a large amount of food for man or beast to the deeply, thoroughly plowed, well-managed and well-tilled acre, are still in ample season. Let every farmer resolve, not to run over more acres, half preparing them to receive the seed and then half tilling them, but to plant and sow so long as he can do so with a reasonable hope of fair harvests, putting in buck-wheat and round turnips when itis too late to sow anything else. Since the Spring of 1817, there probably has not been so complete a dearth of food in the hands of growers throughout three-fourths of the Union as there is this day; while a large por-tion of our people appear to have gone mad with land speculation, and not likely to recover in sea-son to make a crop this year. Minnesota and Kansas, which are all but unequaled in natural fertility, will hardly grow their own bread, and certainly will not produce their own food, this year; Iowa and Wisconsin will hardly do more than feed their own people, including the thousands now moving thither to share their natural blessings. We hope to hear from day to day that the young crops look better and better; but much Wheat is winter-killed, so that the best weather cannot revive it. Let the farmers do their best and the season be propitious, it is hardly possible to grow this year a superabundance of food.
