	Of course there is a secret history to this scandal-ous matter that does not appear from the trial. The vicar was appointed by the late Earl, who was also a prince in the days when the dandies reigned, famous under his courtesy title of Lord Petersham, which we remember he gave to a top-coat, or some piece of apparel or other. As Mr. Highmore swore that he had never had any personal acquaintance with the present Countess, and as the curate testified that she said that the vicar, in company with the late earl and countess had been seen rolling on the floor drunk together, the quarrel had probably come down from the days of the last lord and lady of the castle. This last specification Lady Har-rington particularly contradicted, saying that the late earl was one of the soberest of men; and, if we do not much misremember, he too was one of the few persons of high rank in England who en-courage the Temperance Movement. But all this is of no particular consequence. One thing in evidence, however, was noticeable. One thing in evidence, however, was noticeable. The vicar testi-fied that a memorial window was to be put into the church to the memory of the late countess, and that he had subscribed £25 toward it. Now the late Countess of Harrington was the celebrated Maria Foote, the actress, famous for her long liaison with Col. Berkeley, now Earl Fitzhardinge. After its cessation—she having borne him a family of children—she married the late Earl of Harrington. We know nothing of her history in this last rela-tion, and can only hope that she was worthy of being joined to the saints—or, at least, to the Mag-dalens—whose virtues are usually commemorated in the storied windows of Christian churches.
