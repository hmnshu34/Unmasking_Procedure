	We ought to have a stringent National Bankrupt Law--we ought not to have been without one at any time during the last fifty years. It would have brought seasonable relief and freedom to thousands of honest insolvents; it would have wrought the merited exposure of quite as many knavish bank-rupts; it would have secured to creditors a larger dividend and prompter payment from their insol-vent debtors; it would have divested Shylocks of their often abused power over the unfortunate. But since the People do not think enough of the matter (or think deeply enough) to uphold a Bank-rupt Law, let us have the next best thing--a week-ly publication of the list of bankrupts throughout the country. Thousands will be impelled by a sal-utary fear of this National pillory to pay their debts and maintain their credit unimpaired; while hun-dreds who have shaved one set of creditors nearly to the bone will be disabled by it from walking promptly into the affections of another set. The publication does good every way, and must be continued. The honest bankrupt need not be ashamed of his misfortune; the rogue should be made ashamed of his knavery. Publicity is the true touchstone.
	We see intimation that some bankrupts have been enabled to coax or buy the omission of their names from the weekly list. This, if so, is a griev-ous wrong, to be repented of and amended. We call on Mr. H. C. Bowen, who is understood to be the responsible furnisher of the list, to deny the charge or explain the circumstances to which allu-sion is made. Unless the weekly list of bank-ruptcies is complete and reliable, it is a fraud on the public and invidious toward those whose names are given. If it be so that entreaty or dollars will buy a bankrupt omission from the list, then the pub-lication is a humbug--an unjust, damaging hum-bug--and ought to be stopped. But let the list be perfect and thorough, and it will be a most useful and wholesome publication, whose value will be constantly increasing.
