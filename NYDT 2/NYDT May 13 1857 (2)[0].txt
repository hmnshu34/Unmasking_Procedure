	Commissioners of Excise were yesterday ap-pointed, we trust, in all the counties of our State, in pursuance of the new Liquor Law. We shall be obliged to that friend in each country who will send us the earliest account of the appointment of Commissioners therein, with some hint of their probable action. When they shall finished licens-ing, we shall be thankful for a statement of the number and locality of the licenses granted for said county. The License law may work well, or work ill, or neither decidedly well nor ill; but it is most desirable that the People shall be enabled to judge it fairly and intelligently. We do not, therefore, want one-sided views nor harsh criminations, but simple narration of facts. If there be any county in which the Judges refuse or neglect to appoint, or in which the Commissioners fail to act, or in which they grant licenses in violation of the spirit and intent of the act, we desire to know and to state that fact, with its consequences. Let us en-deavor for once to watch the progress of this ex-periment in repressive legislation with impartial earnestness, and be ready to hold fast the good and countervail the evil which may develop. WE exhort Temperance men, whether friends or adver-saries of the new Law, to unite with other loyal citizens in insisting that it shall be fairly ad-ministered and faithfully enforced, that the People may be prepared to decide justly the question of maintaining or repealing it.
