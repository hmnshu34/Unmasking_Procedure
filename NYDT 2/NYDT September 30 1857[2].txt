       III. Our manufactures, owing to these enormous Imports and their financial consequences, are to a fearful extent paralyzed. All the factories, forges and foundries in the Country are worth to-day in the aggregate less than half their own cost. Many of them are working short time or closed altogether; others must soon follow their example. Just when it is becoming impossible to buy abroad, we are incapacitated for producing at home.
       IV. There is manifestly a hard Winter in pros-pect for our Laboring Class—for those who are usually workers for wages. Tens of thousands of them will not be able to find employment, while others will be forced to work at some vocation in which they can earn very little, and will probably receive even less. We estimate the National loss from inability to find employment during the next half year at not less than One Hundred Millions of dollars. Of course, this involves a very large ag-gregate of individual privation and suffering.
       V. Our Currency of course sympathizes with our Business; hence delay, inconvenience and sacrifice in the forwarding and marketing of this year’s Produce are inevitable. The general collection of debts will necessarily be slow, difficult and uncer-tain.
       --So much for the darker side of the picture Now for the lighter shades:
       VI. We have a vast and fertile country, an intel-ligent and energetic population, with better ma-chinery and implements this day in their hands than those of any other country. Great Britain possibly excepted. If we estimate our entire population at Twenty-six Millions, there must be Ten Millions of the number who are able-bodied workers (male and femal), whose average weekly earnings, their board inclusive, can hardly fall short of $5 per week. The aggregate earnings of our People, then may be swelled to the gross sum of Twenty-five Hundred Millions per annum—an aggregate which dwarfs that of our Foreign Debt, formidable as the latter truly is.
