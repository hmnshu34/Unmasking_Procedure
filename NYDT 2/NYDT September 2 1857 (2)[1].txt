	Lady Harrington was proved by the curate of the parish to have said that the vicar was a low, drunken, gambling, debauched character, who en-couraged the people of the village in the like prac-tices, and that she should consider it sacrilege to receive the sacrament from the hands of so bad a man. Furthermore, that he was always telling us and that he kept the sacrament money and funds contributed for the repair of the church. These were the main allegations, only with some fuller specifications as to times and seasons, and for these the reverend gentleman brought his action for damages. Under the new state of the law as to evidence, both the plaintiff denied all the charges against him, affirming that the sacrament accounts were always open to the parish for inspec-tion, and, as to the charges of drunkenness, that he had been for several years forbidden to use wine on account of his health, and had entirely abstained—though the restriction had since been taken off. Lady Harrington denied having made the accusations in the form attributed to her, explaining that some of the worst of them referred to some former curates of Mr. Highmore. She admitted having said that she would not take the sacrament from him, because he was such a bad man. Her expla-nations, however, had not much weight with the Jury, who returned a verdict for the plaintiff, with damages in £750.
