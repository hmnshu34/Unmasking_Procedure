	These questions suggest answers. If it shall be found, fifty years hence, that our City's population is debauched and imbruted by licentious indulgences and habits--if grog-shops shall glare on every corner and gaming-houses crouch in every street--if popular education shall languish in spite of prod-igal expenditure for its support, and thousands of children grwo up in ignorance, idleness, profligacy and crime--if our polls shall be surrounded and our elections carried by a frenzied, reckless, drunken mob, voting for whichever party promises the freest rein to debauchery, the fullest impunity to vice--if the freedom of speech shall be sacrificed to the fury of rascals and miscreants, resolved that their sins shall not be reproved nor their robberies exposed--if murder shall here be of nightly occur-rence, while robbery and arson deprive the rich of any security or comfort in their possessions, and exorbitant taxation combine with these to divest property of half its value--the blame will rest, where the loss falls, on our selfish and short-sighted capitalists of today, who, in pushing to their utmost limit the advantages of their position, ig-nored its responsibilities and neglected its duties.
