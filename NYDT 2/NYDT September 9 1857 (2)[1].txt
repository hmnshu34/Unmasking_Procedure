	The choicest wealth of any nation is its most skillful and effective industry. All the filibusters who ever were or ever can be sent out of the country never contributed one-half so much to its growth or power as the inventor of the Steamboat or of the Cotton Gin. If a genius should be devel-oped in our day who should teach us how to make Iron from our own Ores decidedly cheaper than we can import the British metal, he will have added more to the power and wealth of this country, to the independence and thrift of it laboring class, than could be achieved by the annexation of the entire continent from Baffin’s Bay to Cape Horn. A Railroad to the Pacific will thus be rendered a far easier achievement than the Erie Canal was forty years ago.
	We urgently need a more intelligent, instructed Laboring Class—instructed not in Greek and Latin, in Algebra and Metaphysics, but in sciences which form the base of Industrial efficiency. We need a Laboring Class familiar with the elemental truths of Chemistry, Geology and Natural History, and skilled in the application of those truths to the achievement of the beneficent ends. We need a Labor-ing Class who find in such an exhibition as the Ameri-can Institute is about to give us instruction and gratification which outweighs in attractiveness the fascination of the theater and the sorceries of the grogshop. We need, in short, a Perpetual Exhibi-tion in our City of the trophies of Industry and Useful Art; an exhibition wherein every successful invention shall be illustrated by specimen or model; every great manufactory by a sample of its pro-ducts; and this we shall have whenever our young mechanics and artisans shall have become wise enough to prefer the improvement to the squander-ing of their leisure hours. Meantime, let us make the most of our Annual Fairs.
