	But there was still justice for this worthy man in New-Orleans. In these days of judicial corruption and tyranny, let us joyfully bear witness to the fairness, the perspicacity, the humanity of Mr. Re-corder Smith. He saw at once the gross absurdity of the charge, and he released the prisoner, who returned in triumph to No. 159 Gravier street, and its elevating and useful pursuits. The only damage which he received was from the poignant grief which such an indignity must have given to his re-fined and gentle mind, and the loss of Mr. Whit-field's trade. But if the latter gentleman's remain-ing Tobies are no sounder than that which made all this trouble, Mr. Screws may consider himself for-tunate in getting rid of such a patron. May quick sales and large profits speedily restore his equa-nimity!
