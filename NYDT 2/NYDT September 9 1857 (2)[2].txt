	We exhort every American inventor, artisan, miner, manufacturer, who has produced anything he deems worthy of public attention, to exhibit it at the Fair now at hand. He can hardly fail to profit by such exhibition; if not, let him carry the loss to the credit of his patriotism. Let us, in spite of commercial and manufacturing depression, show that the cause of American Industry is still onward and upward—that if beaten to the earth today, it rises and renews the struggle to-morrow. If there be any who have products worth showing that they have not hitherto thought of sending to the Palace, we exhort them to resolve at once to exhibit, and to let no hour pass unimproved until they shall have secured the requisite space and filled it. Let us make this the best Fair thus far, and so prepare to eclipse it next year by a better.
