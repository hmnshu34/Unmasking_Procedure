	And you, Sir! who have been hanging about this or some other City for weeks or months, looking for a clerkship, or place as porter, or in some such capacity, be entreated to go out among the farmers and ask one after another to set you to work! It were idle to hang out for any longer, for business is falling off and drying up for the Summer vaca-tion; it will be poorer and poorer henceforth till September. Do not cling to these glistening, fe-verish pavements and repine that you can find nothing to do, when Nature loudly calls you to forsake the spot where work cannot be and go where it certainly is. High rents, dear bread, scanty employment, are admonitions that thousands of you persist in not beeding, herding and crowding where are you not needed and do not properly be-long, when you ought to be growing the food you are sure to need next Winter, if you do not now. Do not stand conjuring up excuses for remaining; do not ask some one to pay your way to some-where else; but set your face westward or north-ward, and travel on foot, until you by inquiry find some one who will give you bread for work; and, unless you are exceedingly incapable or ill-favored, you need not travel far. Secure first an opportu-nity to show what you can do; appreciation and wages will soon follow your demonstration that you deserve them. Man, woman or child, now idle and needy in a city, we exhort you to quit looking for work where work is not cannot be, but go forth into the fields!
