“The people of the State of New-York, repre-“sented in Senate and Assembly,” enacted, at the late Session, certain important changes in the laws whereby said People are governed. One of these changes affects the granting of licenses to sell In-toxicating Beverages; another provide for a removal of our Quarantine establishment; another modifies the Police system of this City and the ad-joining counties; a fourth provides for a change in the constitution of our Board of Supervisors, and there are one or two others of some consequence. That each of these acts was the perfection of wis-dom, no one will pretend; but that they were duly enacted by the legislative organism of our State, no one pretends to question. That, as a whole, they were wise and good acts, calculated to cure or mitigate admitted and flagrant evils, and that their general influence, should they be permitted to take effect, will be salutary, we are confident nine-tenths of all who have dispassionately read them must believe.
	But this is a free country, and any man who doesn’t like a law is at perfect liberty to dislike it. He may, also, if he sees fit, declare such act unconsti-tutional; but this declaration by no means relieves him from the general obligation to obey it. An unconstitutional law is, of course, void; but he who should venture to defy a statute, and, being arraigned for such violation, should plead his belief that said act was unconstitutional, would be de-risively told by the Judge that no such excuse would avail him; he must obey the laws as they are en-acted until a competent tribunal shall have pro-nounced them nullities. If he ventures to disre-gard them before, he must bear the penalties of law-breaking.
