	It has for centuries been the custom of civilized man to devote the first moments of a New Year to reflection--to a review of the past, and to resolutions for the future--to as just estimate of what we have already gained or lost, and to a recognition of the duties which are still before us. This custom is perculiarly beneficial to the individual; for upon this anniversary, when he feels that life, with is continually fleeting opportunities, is slipping away from him, how can he avoid that close and critical self-communion which is too delicate for speech, and is most eloquent in its stera silence? We feel that we should be coarsly trespassing upon the capacity of private joy, and especially of private sorrow, were we to obtrude this morning hackueyed advice or stale and threadbare moralitites. At such an hour, human resoultion is only valuable as it is spontaneous and self-suggested. Amid all the fluctuations of earthly affairs, and whether peace is blessing or war is torturing the nations; whatever follies the stolidity of man may be exhibiting, or however widely his inhumanity to his fellow may be diffusing an epidemic of unhappiness, it must be clear to every thoughtful mind that the surest serenity is to be found in that individual integreity  which is independent of outward circumstances, and which kings can neither give nor take away. And we do think it not an inappropriate suggestion that, while the New Year dawns upon so much human suffering, and while we are compelled to record the persistency of wrong and the triumph of injustice, we are yet sustained by the wisest philosophy in pointing out to every reader how the pleasure which must inevitaly result from a rational self-culture is within his reach. The times do especially demand individual men of character. Never has there been a period in the world's history when so much was to be gained by private virtue, or when houesty of purpose was so emphatically its own exceeding great reward. But, with these palpable reflections, our duty as public journalists creates in that direction, and we turn to a consideration of affairs which are more leligitamately within our province.
