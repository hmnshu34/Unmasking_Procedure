	If these facts still required an official confirma-tion, the Russian Government has just given it. The new organization of the army aims first and mainly at the rooting up of these hotbeds of wholesale embezzlement the subordinate staffs and headquarters. The staffs, both of the army-corps and of brigades, are done away with. Nay, the very name of brigades disappears from the Rus-sian army. The whole six corps of the line are placed under the command of one man, Prince M. D. Gorehakoff I., the late commander in the Crimes. Each corps has, it is true, a commanding general; but as he has no staff--that is to say, no means of actu-ally exercising the details of this command--he is at best but the inspector of his corps--a sort of check on the five generals of division under him. In reality, the generals of the thirty divisions (eighteen of infanrty, six of calvary and six of ar-tillery), forming what is called the "first army," depend directly upon the commander-in-chief; and in each division again, the colonels of the four regi-ments, infantry or calvary, and the chiefs of batte-ries, are diesctly upon the general of the division. The generals of brigade, being entirely superseded by this new arrangement, are attached to the staff of the divisional general, as his lieuten-ants and seconds in command. The reason of all this is plain enough.
