	Upon Prince Gorchakoff the Emperor can rely: and Gorchakoff, again, can to some extent rely upon the officers of his personal staff. With the bureay-cratic nicety and hierarchic gradation of the former system, the direct influence of the commander-in-chief ended with the chiefs of corps; they and their staffs had to transmit the orders to the divisions, whose staffs again handed them to the brigades, from whose staffs they they reached the colonels of regiments, who saw to their actual execution. This was nothing but a well-organized scheme of fraud, embezzlement and larceny; and the better the service itself was organized, the better organ-ized and the more successful was the plundering of the treasury. This was shown in the march of the first, second and third army-corps from Polnad to the South during the war; and it is simply with a view of removing the evil that the Russian Govern-ment has done away with all but the names of the commanders of corps, and entirely with the com-manders of brigades. There are now but two inter-mediate grades between the commander in chief and the company officers, namely, the general divis-ion and the colonel; and their is but one staff, that of the division, which can be used for purposes of embezzlement. If the Government should succeed in eradicating the habit of plunder from the divis-ional staffs,  it may reasonably expect to banish it, by and by, from the regiments also.
