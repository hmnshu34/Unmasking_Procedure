	The last message of Mr. Pierce has called forth many speeches more critical than complimentary. We do not know that any retiring President has ever before received so many farewell shots, or been subjected to such a cannonade from the Oppo-sition ramparts. At the first glance this does not appear to be very generous, and we sigh for that aroma of good feeling which has heretofore surrounded defunet politicians. But Mr. Pierce would not permit us to part with him upon good terms, or to forget, while we were interchanging compliments, that he had been a very bad President. He saw fit to send to Congress the most thoroughly partisan message which ever came from the White House; he saw fit to make the closing act of his administration a special plan in behalf of its greatest blunder; he saw fit to stigmatize whole States, and these the most powerful and important of the Confederacy, as false to the Constitution. Such attacks necessarily provoke retort; and we only wonder that the riddling has not been more thorough and the repartee more acrimonious.
