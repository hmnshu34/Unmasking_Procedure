	We have already show in repeated articles that the assumption of these three Judges that, in Colo-nial times and at the period of the adoption of the Constitution, negroes were considered incapable of possessing and enjoying any social and political rights, as fit only to be slaves, and totally unfit, under any and all circumstances, to be citizens, is absolutely and most glaringly and atrociously false, to such an extent, in fact, that at the time of the adoption of the Constitution free negroes and eman-cipated slaves did possess the right of suffrage on the same terms with the whites in every one of the original thirteen States, except South Carolina, and possibly Delaware. But not only are these three Judges thus detected in a gross falsification—for it is impossible to presume that they could have been merely ignorant—we have also shown that, as is very apt to happen in such cases, this falsification was to no purpose, as these false representations would not have helped them even had they been true. By calling attention to the state of public feeling in the colonies and States, down even to the time of the Revolution and since, toward persons of the Roman Catholic faith, and the whole current of legislation in respect to them, we have shown, we think be-yond the possibility of contradiction, that they were regarded with at least as much antipathy and were subjected to quite as many disabilities as free ne-groes, and that if the argument of Mr. Chief-Justice is valid to show that the state of opinion at that time excluded free negroes from the possibility of citizenship, an argument equally strong might be made that Chief-Justice Taney, being a Catholic, is not, and under the Constitution cannot be, a citizen of the United States, the list of the excluded will by no means be confined to negroes and Catholics, but quite a large and varied number of persons will fall under the same category with Dred Scott and Chie-Justice Taney.
