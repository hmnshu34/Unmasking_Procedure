	In a recent answer to the Journal des Debats, The London Times gives up in the name of England to France every pretension to the leadership in European affairs, reserving for the English nation the undisputed direction of the affairs of Asia and America, where no other European power must interfere. It may, nevertheless be doubted if Louis Bonaparte will accept this division of the world. At any rate, French diplomacy in Teheran during the late mis-understandings did not heartily support England: and the French press exhuming and ventilating Gaille pretensions to Kareg seems to forshadow that England will not find an easy game to at-tack and disember Persia.
