	Ever since he came home he has been baited and badgered to a degree which seems to have exacerbated to the hight the naturally somehwat acidulous temper of the Napiers. Speeches at public meetings and in Parliment, letters in the newspapers, and pamphlets good store, have been resorted to to let off his superfluous head of steam. Among other things he has done, he has visited St. Petersburg since the peace and examined the fortifications of Cronstadt, and has satisfied himself by ocular de-monstration that they would have been too many for him and his fleet, and that he did wisely in de-clining to run his head against them. This may be true, but it is by no means flattering to the vanity of the British nation, and it has certainly had no effect in slackening the fate that has been kept upon him for so long. Admiral Berkeley, a Lord of the Admiralty, we think, publicly declared that it was Sir Charles Napier's fault that Cronstadt was not taken. Sir Robert Peel, another junoir Lord of the Admiralty, has declared that he had it from the highest authority that there was by one opin-ion among all grades of the Roman fleet, from the Admiral to the Midshipman, as to the want of enterprise displayed by Sir Charles Napier. And the worst of it is, that these functionaries seem to speak the sense of the nation.
