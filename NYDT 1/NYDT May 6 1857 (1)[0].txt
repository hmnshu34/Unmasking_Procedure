	A little more than two years ago, the Legislature of our State, after years of hesitation and thought passed an act to suppress Intemperance, by prohib-iting the traffic in Intoxicating Drinks. No man could complain of this act as partial. It laid the ax to the root of the tree. Lordly saloons and loathsome hovels, fashionable hotels and subterran-nean drunkeries, were alike forbidden, under equal penalties, to sell Alcoholic Liquors, except for medical or other bibulous purpose. And, while the act was widely condemned as too radical and sweeping, no man ventured to stigmatize it as aimed at an imaginary evil, or warring on a friend instead of a foe to human happiness. The general complaint of its adversaries imported that it cut too deeply--that, instead of restricting itself to the acknowledged abuses of drinking, it confounded those abuses with the legitimate use--that, instead of seeking to abolish or purify only the loathsome haunts of debauchery and vice, it included with them the resorts of rational and moderate enjoyment in one sweeping condemnation. 
	Fernando Wood was the newly chosen Mayor of our city when this act was passed, and had signal-ized himself by a pledge to enforce all laws and ordinances bearing on our city, even though this should involve the assumption of "doubtful powers." But the moment he was called to choose be-tween fidelity to his pledge and the favor of the Liqour interest, he cast the former to the winds. Without waiting for or even invoking any judicial decision on the subject, he set to work at once to circumvent and nullify the Prohibitory Law, and succeeded. His control over the Police enabled him to render the act a dead letter, so far as this city was concerned, and thus subject it to general odium as impracticable. No man did more than he to effect its overthrow.
