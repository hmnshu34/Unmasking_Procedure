	This, however, the Staten Islanders—that is, a portion of them—would not allow. They had clam-ored the establishment away from Castleton; but they would not allow it to be located anywhere else—that is, at any place where a quarantine for the ensuing season of danger from contagion could be located. So they held a public meeting, enter-tained each other with blood-and-fury speeches, and with resolves importing that the Quarantine should be located on Seguine’s Point, or at least should not be maintained there. The upshot of this ebul-lition is the burning of the edifice in which the tem-porary or summer quarantine was to have been es-tablished—an act of destruction of State property which was undoubtedly the work of an incendiary. And such is the state of feeling in which this arson originated that the instrument as well as the insti-gators will doubtless escape the legal penalty of their crime.
	There is a moral in this whole business which those who are traducing and misrepresenting the Excise, Charter Reform and other acts of our late Legislature, and counseling resistance and nullif-cation, will do well to ponder.
