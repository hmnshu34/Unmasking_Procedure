	The Spanish coin now in circulation in this country is unquestionably a nuisance, to be abated as speedily as possible; but that its intrinsic value is anything like 20 per cent less than its nominal valu-ation we do not believe. It seems hardly equitable that the Government, after having neglected its duty of supplying the country with a plentiful and uniform currency, and after having countenanced at least, if not legalized, the circulation of Spanish coin, should now shirk all responsibility, and, what is worse, create a panic by which a good many poor people will be swindled out of very considerable sums. Following the hint given by Congress, some of the largest receivers of small coin in this city have already commenced the reduction, taking 6 1/4-cent pieces at 5 cents; 12 1/4 cents at 10 cents. Some of these still continue to receive quarters at the old count of 25 cents, and others have already reduced them to the value of two dimes. This opens a field for small peculations, against which people should be warned. Of course, every sharper will endeavor to crowd off all the coins on hand upon the unwary at their old and familiar value, and then he will take in others at the reduced rate and pay them out at 20 per cent profit; and finally the loss will fall upon women and children, and that class who work most and read least. Now, this is a cheat and a seception unworthy of any government, and espe-cially of the Government of the United States. There was another course which might have been pursued, and which it is not too late to pursue. The reduction might have been made prospective; receivers might have been authorized to take these coins at their former value and send them to the Mint to be recoined. In this way the loss, what-ever it might be, would fall where it ought to fail, upon the whole people, and not upon a class.
