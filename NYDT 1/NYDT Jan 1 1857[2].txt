	Today we especially remember how human affairs continually ferment, and how seldom they come to a conclusion and may be considered finished. And we feel this to be particularly true in regard to the great controversy which has agitated and is still agitating the United States of America, and which has been so important as to attract the attention and excite the sympathies of the world. Upon that memorable Twentieth of May, when Mr. Charles Sumner pronounced his most magnificent oration to Kansas, and the nation was roused by the finest parliamentary denunciations since those of Burke, the distinguished Senator remarked in conclusion that the controversy would "soon" be transferred from Congress to a "broader stage"--"to the people, then upon the "eve of excercising the elective franchise." We have appealed against nameless crimes and un-speakable injustice to "the multitudinous might" of the ballot-box, and the response has not been such as to gratify the benevolent and hopeful heart. With a strange fatuity , the people of this country professing to be governed by liberal principles, and, in fact, devoted to a theoretical democracy, have endured an absolutism which might have originatedin the brain of Mr. Patt and have been carried inti practice by a Sidmouth or a Castlereagh. No Administration ever departed so widely from the principles of the American Constitution as that of Franklin Pierce. He has been the great Republican Bomba. We have had during the year which is now closed an espionage and a military despotism which would have been considered the hight of policy by Mestersich and the grossest wrong by our owa Jefferson. It seems incredible that the Democratic party should swing so far from its principles, or a party which had its origin in a desire to protect freedom of thought should finally sink into the support of the worst tyranny.
