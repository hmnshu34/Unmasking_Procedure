	The excitement growing out of locating “tem-porary Hospitals” at Seguine’s Point, has given rise to very many explanations or theories relative to the spread of Yellow Fever as it appeared on Long Island last Summer. The most confident theory promulgated is, that the infection of the fever is wafted by the wind from vessels under quarantine; that if vessels infected with poison were anchored within a mile and a half from any shore, where the breeze passing over the vessels blows constantly upon that shore for several days in succession, the citizens will be subjected to the pestilence—not those alone who reside in close proximity to the shore, but those also who live at points remote from it, several miles in the country. 
	In the settlement of the question, where Quaran-tine shall be located, it is important to know the facts relative to the influence of the winds on in-fected vessels, and how far the poison from the same can be or has been carried, under the most favorable circumstances. This matter can be bet-ter demonstrated by the experience of this port last Summer, than by reference to that of another season, or any other port, for the reason that the amount of disease which was brought into the bay of New-York during the past season was probably in excess of that of any other period, either at this or any other port.
