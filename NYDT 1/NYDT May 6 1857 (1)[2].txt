	The pretense that this law was passed by "the dominant party"--that is, the Republicans--is equally mean and false. Its authors and original advocates were nearly all conspicuous "Democrats" or "Americans." The "Republicans" held off, being mainly in favor of Prohibition. It was only when the Floyd Joneses, &c., deserted their own bantling, that many Republicans resolved to let it have a trial. Its final passage in the Assembly was carried by the votes of 51 Republicans, 10 Democrats, abd 6 Americans, voted against it. In the Senate it was carried by the votes of fire Republicans, nine Americans, and four Democrats, including the two from this city--in fact all the four Senators from this city (two Democrats and two Americans) voted for the bill. Against it were nine Republicans, one American, and not one Democrat. The Democratic party alone gave a unanimous vote int its favor. The Democrats might have beaten it in either house--had they voted against it half so generality as the Republicans did, they would have beaten it in the Senate. In view of these facts, judge what must be the demagogue who, for a local partisan ad-vantage, tells the ten thousand rumsellers of this city that the New License law is an act of "the dominant (Republican) party." How they roll back upon him his base calumnies about "the "dogmas of a party which has always acknowl- "edged the possession of property as a proof of "merit," about "privileged classes," "monopo- "lists," and "the unfortunate poor men." We should hail, with far more satisfaction than Fer-nando Wood, an act whereby the "privileged class" of legalized liqour sellers should be utterly abol-ished, as it was until Fernando Wood and a Democratic Court of Appeals revived it. But how base, how villainous is the appeal made by our model demagogue to the prejudices of poverty, in view of the facts which a true history of this Liquor controversy develops!
