	There are many objectionable features connected with these fairs, but it is their direct encouragement of the spirit of gambling and illegitimate speculation that is most to be condemned ; and we refer to them at this time, because we know of none being either in progress or contemplation, and hence our objections are intended to be general in their scope, and not intended to have any particular application.  All sects we believe have resorted to this expedient for replenishing the exchequer and there is no room for invidious distinction.  We would have preferred to avoid the subject but find it impossible, as the conducters of such projects insist on having them puffed in the papers, and as we cannot consent to such a use of our columns, we will feel bound in future to recommend all gambling and lottery enterprises to the notice of the authorities, whose duty it is to suppress them.
