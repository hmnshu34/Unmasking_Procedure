May 13th, 1857

	New York city is all animation with the religious flock who have gathered to recount the progress of religion, the conversion of the heathen and success of the contribution box.  In the evening, the general Anniversary of the New York Union was held.  The New York Colonization Society, the American and Foreign Christian Union, the Port Societies had their Anniversaries.  The Infirmary, of which the Misses Drs. Blackwell and Miss Dr. Tarewski are at the head, had a very interesting opening Anniversary.
	The Garrisonian abolitionists are holding their Anniversary meetings at the City Assembly Rooms.  They had two meetings yesterday, a morning and an evening one.  The morning meeting was addressed by Wm. Lloyd Garrison of Boston; Rev. Thos. V. Higginson, of Worcester, Mass.; Parker Pillsbury, of Concord, N.H.; Robert Purvis (a colored man,) of Byberry, Pa.; Miss Lucy Stone and Wendell Phillips, of Boston.
	These wretched lunatics howled in favor of immediate dissolution of the Union and other trash too absurd to excite any other feeling than contempt.  The receipts of the society for the year were $19,308 63, and of the auxiliary societies in Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan, $18,854 03, making a total of $38,162 66.  The total expenditures were $83,979 12.
