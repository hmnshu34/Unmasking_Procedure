The Summer Hegira

May 27th, 1857

	The Herald is laboring to prevent the vagrant fasionables from going to Newport, Saratoga, and the other summer resorts of financial swindlers and moral bankrupts.  Whatever natural advantages of mineral springs or good sea-bathing these places may afford, are more than counterbalanced by the character of their frequenters and the style of proceedings carried on.  Gamblers and blacklegs,  counterfeit counts and barbers' apprentices converted into foreign noble men ; ladies with damaged characters and mothers with unsaleable daughters,--are the lions and lionesses, heroes and heroines of these fashionable resorts.  A few upstart snobs of the Brown and Jones families wish to establish a fashionable reputation by visiting these resorts, and not a few go off to avoid the increasing familiarity of the butcher and baker.  The mode of life at these places is such as might be expected.
	The males spend the time at billiards, tenpins, bar-room loafing, drinking, smoking, and paying miscellaneous attentions to ladies.  The latter dress sixteen times a day in unpaid-for finery, gorge themselves with jellies and other trash, drink wines, dance every night till morning, indulge in high-pressure flirtations, fall in love with perfumed pickpockets, and such of them as have any character to lose frequently contrive to leave it behind them.
	As to the effects of the summer migrations on the health, one season at these places is sufficient to lay the foundation of consumption, dyspepsia, and as many other diseases as the last new quack medicine professes to cure.  Packed together as close as a barrel of mackerel, sleeping in crowded garrets, living on decayed vegetables and indigestible  and villainous compounds, for which three prices are charged,-- spending the night at German dances, champagne of New Jersey manufacture, and going to bed with aching heads, sweltering bodies, and nightmare stomachs ; the only wonder is that they hold out to the end of the season.
