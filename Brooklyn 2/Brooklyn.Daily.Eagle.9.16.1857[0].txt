The Nomination of Judge Denio

September 16th, 1857

	A few factious persons are dissatisfied with the renomination of Judge Denio on the ground of his sustaining the Metropolitan Police Bill.-- Now to our mind had the Democratic Convention thrown him overboard on this ground it would have proclaimed the insincerity of its own professions, and placed itself on a level with the Black Republican politicians, who sustain laws and judges as long as their provisions and decisions correspond with their own abstract ideas of a loose transcendental morality, and denounce both, and vilify both, and preach rebellion to both, when they do not suit that Procrustan standard.
	If there is one principle for which conservative men contend it is the absolute supremacy of the laws of the land.  If any law is oppressive or unjust the people have a constitutional remedy in their hands in the election of members of the Legislature to annul it.  And when a law is contested and the highest law court in the land decides that it does not conflict with the constitution, or the principles on which our government is based, that decision stands irrevocably.  Such at least is the Democratic doctrine.  But if the Courts are independent and do not become Black Republican machines, perish the Courts ! shouts Greeley ; and Littlejohn and the Republican Legislature re-echo the cry.  They ostracise independence in the Judiciary--shall we follow the example.
