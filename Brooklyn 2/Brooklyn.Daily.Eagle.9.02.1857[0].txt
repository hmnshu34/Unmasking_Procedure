The Primary Elections

September 7th, 1857

	Great Complaint has been made, and that is has been justly made no one can deny, concerning the manner in which the primary elections have of late years been conducted.  Disorder and violence have characterised these elections, and fraud too often takes the place of numbers.  There are at this moment dozens of persons in the various wards who may be seen around corner grogshops, or sometimes in the vicinity of the City Hall, ready to "manage" primary elections, and return anybody who will most liberally purchase the favor.
	It was supposed that the removal of the appointment of inspectors of primary meetings from the wards to the general committee would remedy some of the evils previously existing; but, as might have been expected, the change has not operated in a satisfactory manner.  To invest any one individual with the power of controlling the primary election in his ward, as the appointment of inspectors actually does, is to place temptations in his way to seduce him into the grinding of his own axes.  There is a general desire to return to the old method, if no better can be devised, and let the respective wards conduct the primaries without any dictation by the general committees, except as to naming the time and place for holding the elections.  Let the voters of a ward meet publicly together and there appoint inspectors openly and above board, either by acclamation or balloting, as may be agreed upon.
