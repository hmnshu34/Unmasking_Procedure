Independence of the Judiciary

September 23rd, 1857

	It is quite natural that the Democracy of the "Metropolitan Police District" should feel very indignant at the high handed measures of the late Legislature ; and that their feelings should obscure their reason.  Hence the partial dissatisfaction attending the nomination of Judge Denio.  Why should we vote for the Judge who approved of the Metropolitan Police Bill? is asked by the Democratic voters.  The answer is that he did not do any such thing.  So far from this being the case there is distinct evidence in his decision that he disapproved of the measure as much as any inhabitant of the prescribed district.  He says in that decision that there is room for a great deal of bad legislation inside the Constitution, and no one will be found to dispute the statement at least.
	The simple question is--did Judge Denio believe, and had he good legal grounds for believing that the Police Bill did not directly conflict with the constitution.  The simple fact that six of the eight members of the Court decided as he did, is proof sufficient that the law was not one of those acts which come into direct conflict with the fundamental law of the State.  Then what would we have Judge Denio do ? To decide that the law was null and void against his reason and convictions because such a decision would aid his political party and injure its opponents?  If we are prepared to admit such a conclusion then why have Judges at all?  Let the highest legal questions be decided by a political caucus, and let us inaugurate the milennium of Greeley at once, for that is precisely the doctrine of Black Republicanism against which we have been contending.
