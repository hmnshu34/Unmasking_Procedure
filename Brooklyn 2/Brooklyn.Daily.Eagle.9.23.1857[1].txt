	Judge Denio decided against the Nine Million Loan, and the Maine Liquor Law.  These were enactments framed by the same Legislators who passed the Police Bill.  When they find the constitution and Courts against the Maine Law, what do they propose to do!  To frame future enactments so as to conform to the Constitution and the undivided rights of the people ? Not at all ; but to obtain the possession of the Courts, and place on the bench tools of their own who will confirm a violation of the Constitution, and abrogate trial by jury and all the personal rights and immunities that stand in the way of fanatical experiments.  Are we to imitate the example, and demand of Judges that they decide in favor of their party right or wrong?  We trust not ; and yet, stripped of its sophistry, this is what the objections to Judge Denio's nomination amount to.
	There has been some talk of Judge Denio being nominated by the Republicans ; but we venture the prediction that he will receive the cold shoulder from that party.  He decided in favor of the Police bill because an impartial discharge of his duty compelled him ; but the Republicans must have a Judge who will decide in their favor on all questions coming before him, simply because his party desires it.  They want a Judge who will decide in favor of the Maine Laws, of nine million plunder, of runaway negroes, and of every scheme Thurlow Weed may think proper to hatch.  Whether judges are to decide according to law or to party dictation is the point of difference between the Democracy of the State and the Black Republicans.  The vote for Judge Denio will indicate how the people at large feel on the subject.
