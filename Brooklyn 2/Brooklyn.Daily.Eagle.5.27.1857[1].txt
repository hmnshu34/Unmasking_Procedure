	Compared with this style of doing things, a summer tour among the hills and streams where "rock, wood, and water" aboundand nature invites her wearied children to her ever fresh and bounteous bosom is like paradise to the other place of Hyperion to a satyr.
	No regard is ever had to these considerations ; so long as any place is "fashionable" it will be patronised.  If the Herald can only convince Mrs Grundy that the goddess of fasion has departed from these shrines, she will desert them too, and the whole tribe of Smiths and Snooks will follow.  If told that Staten Island or Seguin Point was the fasionable locality they would rush there despite the mosquitoes, cholera and yellow fever.
	In fact, there is no heroism like that of Fashion's votaries.  There is no shape, from that of a hickory pole to a beer barrel or baloon into which they will not transform themselves at the word of command.  Though unequal to the toil of hemming a pocket handkerchief, or helping themselves to a sandwich, they expend as much physical power at the polka in one night as if properly economised would turn a grist mill or propel a locomotive.
