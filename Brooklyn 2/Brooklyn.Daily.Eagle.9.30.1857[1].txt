	A few years ago many of the depositors of Brooklyn aSvings Banks drew out of their funds and rushed into the intricate and labyrinthine swindles of Building Associations.  They have since discovered, to their loss, that they made a lamentable mistake  A few Shylock Secretaries, have made money out of these cheating institutions while those who entered them, either as borrowers or lenders, have been mercilessly fleeced.  The rage to acquire wealth without earning it, is so extensive a passion that it affords an endless field for the ingenuity of sharpers, who seem never to lack dupes.  The slow and sure pathway of honest industry, may not be so attractive but it leads to more satisfactory results.  Five per cent per annum in a Savings Bank may not be such an inducement as the glittering bubbles of speculation, or the specious frauds of vote-your-self a-house-and-lot, and every-man-his-own-landlord societies ; but it will be found the most advantageous in the end.
	The city of Brooklyn suffers less from the prevailing scarcity of money than any other city in the country.  None of our banks or institutions are in peril ; all are sound and prosperous.  The three savings banks of the city are in a flourishing condition, and no one need hesitate to make either the depository of his earnings.  They pay as liberal a rate of interest as a regard for the safety of the funds committed to their care will admit of.  The results of these banks go beyond the immediate depositors.  They serve to receive and attract money in plentiful times and pay it out in a time like the present, and thus confer a benefit on the whole community.
