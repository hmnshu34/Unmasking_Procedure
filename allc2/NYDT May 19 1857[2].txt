	The Mayor and his backers have a right to dis-obey the new Police act so far as may be necessary to make a case on which to test its constitutionality in the courts—so far, and no farther. Beyond that, they are under the same imperative obligation to obey this act that the humblest citizen is to obey any act whatever. Let any citizen persist in throwing ashes or garbage into the streets, and being told to quit it, tell the Mayor’s Police that be believed it his constitutional, indefeasible right to throw out offal in front of his own lot or house, and his Honor would make short work of his crotchets and scruples. He would tell the offender that he was welcome to protest and contest, but he must nevertheless obey the laws or suffer the penalty of transgressors. 
	No principle is more clearly settled than this—A legislative act, except for the purpose of contest-ing it and so far as may be necessary for that object, is to be obeyed as valid until pronounced otherwise by a competent tribunal. And yet The Journal of Commerce is impelled to say in Wood’s behalf:
	“It appears to us that if these Albany-made Com-missioners disregard the recommendations of the Chief Magistrate of the city, and insist on forcing their doubtful authority upon the community, in defiance of public opinion and public good, they assume very grave responsibilities. Mayor Wood seems resolved not to shrink from a determined effort to maintain a position to strongly backed by right, and by the general sentiments of the people he representes.”
