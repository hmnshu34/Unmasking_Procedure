Tuesday, May 12, 1857. The Progress of Centralization. A letter from Governor King to the alleged Police Commissioners under the so-called Metropolitan Police not has been published, enjoining them to assist the Quarantine Commissioners by every means in their power, and suitably to protect any new buildings they may erect on the spot chosen for a yellow fever depot on Staten Island.
We have no doubt but this is a very proper and judicious injunction. If the Commissioners have any rights they deserve to be protected in the exercise of those rights, and the police are the best persons to afford them protection. But the republican papers who have so vehemently repudiated the notion that this Metropolitan Police act was a commencement of centralization, will hardly deny that this is centralization itself.
Here is Governor King, sitting in his house at Albany, who undertakes thought his own nominees to regulate and administer the private affairs of Richmond county! This is the practice in France, we know. The Emperor Napoleon manages the affairs of every department, commune and village, by writing to his maires and prefets: as, for instance, Monsieur le Prefet, be so good as build your church steeple three feet higher; or Monsieur le Maire, have the kindness to sweep your streets at 9 and not 6 A.M. THis is the French method-the Emperor being everything, and doing everything-the people being and daring to do nothing of themselves. We see, too, what fruit it has yielded.
