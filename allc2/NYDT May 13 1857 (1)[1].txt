	All might indeed have gone along harmoniously if the Toby had not had the audacity, the malignity, the meanness to die, like an ill-conditioned, un-grateful and unscrupulous chatted as it was. Actually, after having been warranted in the most complimentary manner by no less a connoisseur than Mr. Benj. Screws, it persisted in turning out unsound, cracked and fatally flawed, thus bringing disgrace upon the heretofore unspotted reputation of No. 159 Gravier street, and casting suspicion upon Mr. Screw's entire stock of warranted house-maids and unblemished carpenters. But this Toby was quite superior to all considerations of delicacy and kindness, and so shuffled off its mortal coil, and went to a place where it will never be brought into the market, and in which it will be without the slightest value to its bereaved pur-chaser. Col. Hardy naturally felt himself aggrieved. A dead Toby was of no use to him. He wanted a Toby that could grind sugar and hoe cane, a Toby that would wince when he whipped it, a fetching and a carrying Toby; and here he had something of no more value than a deceased dog. Of course he sent to Screws and requested him to refund the thirteen hundred and fifty. But this did not suit Whitfield, the original owner of the Toby. He also sent to Screws for the purchase-money. Screws was in a tight place. Screws was screwed. He did not like to lose both his reputation and his cash. While cogitating the matter, he was at the in-stigation of Whitfield, seized by the myrmidons of the law and dragged as an embezzler and a de-faulter before the Recorder. Unhappy Benjamin Screws!
