Unfortunately, however, for the accuracy of these various items of semi official information-unfortunately, too, we will say, for the credit of some of the nonentities who represent us abroad-the Chevalier goes out to Europe without any local or general authority connected with our foreign missions. We are neither to have the advantage of his valuable services in a consulship nor as flapper-general to our European legations. We deplore it for the sake of the country, we deplore it for that of his numerous well-wishers of the press. Judging from the highly eulogistic tone of the articles which have lately appeared in the columns of our city contemporaries, it seems to us that no appointment would have been more popular. The President, however, has not thought fit to act upon the recommendations so broadly given him, so Wikoff returns to Europe without a post, but still, like Cincinnatus, as distinguished and as inextinguishable in his obscurity as in any political elevation that could be conferred upon him.
We believe that the Chevalierâ€™s present visit to Europe has relation solely to his own private affairs, and not to say political object whatsoever. He goes to Paris to re-publish in French his last remarkable work, in which he so ably analyses the condition of France in 1851 and the events which led to the coup de fiat. The Emperor has, we understand, read the narrative in English, and is so gratified with the general tone of it, that he has waived in its favor the interdict on foreign political works. Its publication in Paris, at the present moment, is calculated to be of great service to the Imperial regime, and there is no doubt that its author will in turn reap some benefit from it. This task accomplished, cur roving diplomat will probable again turn his attention to political affairs. The settlements of the Indian difficulty and the accommodation of the quarrel with Commissioner Yeh are objects which may open up a sufficient field to his ambition.
