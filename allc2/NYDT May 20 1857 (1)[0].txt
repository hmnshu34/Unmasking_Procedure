	Law abiding citizens who are not involved in politics do not seem to appreciate the extraordinary and hazardous position in which they are placed by the rebellion against the authority of the State un-dertaken by Mayor Wood and encouraged by the lower strata of Border-Ruffian politicians and office-holders. The city of New-York is in a state of anarchy, and in danger at any moment of conflagra-tion and rapine. Not only the Police act, but all laws and ordinances are set at defiance, and nothing stands between the honest men and the knife of the assassin--between his warehouse and the torch of the incendiary--but the vague impression that the first overt act of unusual magnitude would be the signal for a Vigilance Committee to purge the Metropolis, from the City Hall to Har-lem River, according to the bloody and merciless code recently executed in San Francisco. It is with no ordinary apprehension that one can delib-erately survey the conditions which have brought us to this pass, and which inevitably point to such a fearful future. For the first time in the history of an American city, we find the Chief Magis-trate heading, not a peaceful legitimate protest against supposed unconstitutional enactments, but a bold and defiant rebellion in advance of Judicial trial. Instead of submitting, as by his oath he is bound to do, to all regularly-enacted laws of the State, he chooses to set aside his oath and endanger the public safety by refusing to recognize such laws. He calls together his political friends and openly takes up arms against the laws as a party man, not as an officer; for Tammany Hall, not for the people; and the boast now is, among the City Hall officials, that they will surely upset the laws, simply because their party have a majority of the Judges of Appeals. The rebellion, as we have heretofore shown, is purely political; undertaken to support the falling fortunes of the political adventurer, Fer-nando Wood, and relying for future justification upon the political bias of the Court of last resort.
