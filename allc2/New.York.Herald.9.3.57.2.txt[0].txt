Thursday, September 3, 1857. The President and the Forty Clergymen. We stated some days since that the President had written a remarkable letter to some forty professors and clergymen of New England, in reply to an address from them on the Kansas question, requesting him to withdraw all troops, and let the Topeka party have full sway. This letter has been the subject of diligent inquiry among the laity, as well as among the clergy, and we are entitled to gratify the curiosity of all by publishing it in another column this morning.
It is masterly production, and must have astonished “the forty clergymen” not a little when they received it. They evidently went off at half-cock in setting forth their charges against the President, and his severe rebuke at their want of charity is not the less outting for being clothed in courteous language. Mr. Buchanan’s exposition of his duty as the first magistrate of the country is most masterly, and the clear and forcible manner in which he cites the laws that bind him under his oath of office will carry conviction to every unprejudiced mind of all the unlawful character and utter folly of the agitators in Kansas. His position toward the Topeka Convention is precisely similar to that of President Madison toward the old Hartford Convention, and he will follow that  precedent, that has been sustained by the good sense of the whole country for more than forty years. He will take no notice of the proceedings of such “illegal and dangerous combinations” until they shall perform some set that will bring them in neutral collision with the constitution, and then “they shall be resisted and put down by the whole power of the government.” This is said with the force of a Jackson; and we think the whole letter will form a subject of deep reflection to “the forty clergymen,” and receive the hearty assent of the people of the United States.
