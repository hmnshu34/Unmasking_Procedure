	Whatever may be the issue of the discussion which Dr. Bellows has initiated--and we do not anticipate that any essential change will thereby be effected in the relative numbers of the friends and adversaries of the Drama as it actually exists among us--there is one proposition brought more distinctly into view by his Address which cannot be suffered to fall into oblivion. That proposition affirms that good men have a duty to perform with respect to Public Recreations, and that this duty has been and is grieviously neglected in our City.
	That popular recreations form a very important part of the education of that masses, especially in cities--that they may be of such a nature as to instruct, refine and elevate, or of such as to debase, corrupt and demoralize--no one will seriously dis-pute. Between a great National Gallery of Paint-ings and Statuary like that of the Louvre and a representation of Model Artists or a bull-fight, there is nearly as great a moral distance as be-tween a Sunday school and a gambling groggery. Each is, in a certain sense, a popular resort--a place of entertainment; but one is calculate to exalt and ennoble its visitors, while the other can scarecely fail to pollute and degrade them. 
	On whom, then--and we ask the question in deep earnestness--is devoted the immense responsibil-ity of providing amusements for this vast commu-nity--of choosing and presenting those calculated to exert a salutary influence and repressing those of a contrary tendency? How are they selected or trained for this high function? By what sacri-fices of private interest to public good, by what contempt of personal advantage or heroic resist-ance to sensual allurement, have they shown them-selves worthy to discharge the high trust of cater-ers for that innocent yet perilous desire for recrea-tion inherent in all men, but most imperatively felt by the ignorant, the thoughtless, the easily led astray?
