Wednesday, May 13, 1857. The SIckles and Murphy Affair. We publish in another column the reply of Mr. John McLeod Murphy to the last bulletin of Mr. Daniel E. Sickles, in relation to the fracas between these two gentlemen at Willard’s Hotel, Washington. Mr. Murphy walks into Mr. Sickles without special ceremony, and Mr. Sickles walks into Mr. Murphy by obtaining his dismissal from office through his (Sickles’) influence with Mr. Buchanan and Mr. Toucey. 
This latter circumstance affords another instance of the melancholy mistakes that have been made by the present administration in dispensing the federal patronage at this point. With the exception, perhaps, of Mr. Schell, there seems to be a fatality attendant upon all of Mr. Buchanan’s appointments in this city and State. We have every reason to believe that Mr. Murphy, whom we know to be in a worthy and honorable man, was removed from office at the instigation of Sickles; and that the motive of Sickles originated in the fact that Mr. Murphy happened to favor some person other than Sickles as the democratic candidate for United States Senator before the Legislature last winter. If we are rightly informed Mr. Sickles made various applications for the removal of Mr. Murphy to the President and the Secretary of the Navy, entirely on personal grounds, and we are very sorry to see that Mr. Buchanan and Mr. Toucey should have acted under such unworthy instigations.
