	Without further pressing this inquiry, or analyzing the motives, the impulses, which have filled and are still recuruiting the ranks of our caterers for the amusement of the public, we may barely ask. How are social magnates fulfilling their responsibility in this regard? Our men of wealth, of elegant and varied culture, of social standing and influence, what are they doing to provide wholesome recrea-tion for their less fortunate fellow-citizens, and shield them from those essentially corrupting and vicious? We know what one man is doing in this direction; long may the Cooper Institute survive to attest his wise and generous public spiritl we accord due credit to the subscribers whose money built the Academy of Music; we hope our grand-children may derive some benefit from the Central Parkl but where are the galleries, the museums, the repositories of designs and inventions, which befit a great commercial metropolis like this, boast-ing its thousands of affluent and hundreds of very wealthy citizens, most of whom have been enriched by the rapid growth and marvelous thrift of our City? Why should capitals of third-rate kingdoms like Saxony, or sub-kingdoms like Tuscany, boast galleries immeasurably superior to anything that New York can show? Why should our one capa=cious and creditable edifice (the Crystal Palace) stand dismantled and desolate, begging some one to buy it for the amount of its debts or its value as old iron? Is there in the civilized world another City so populous and wealthy as New-York which is so meagerly provided as she is with places of popular resort which appeal effectively and benefi-cently to the intellectual and moral nature of their visitors?
