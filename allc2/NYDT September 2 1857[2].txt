	“1. Resolved, That this Convention regards the late action of the American Tract Society, on the sub-ject of Slavery, as unconstitutional and unjust, and especially offensive, as breathing a restless, persistent disposition to meddle with what does not belong to them.
	“2. Resolved, That the members of this body can=not contribute funds to the American Tract Society, nor recognize its agents or colporteurs, while the action referred to remains unretracted; and that we advise our brethren and friends throughout the State to adopt a similar course.”
	Now, we think it is very clear that the Board and its Secretaries can no longer halt between two opin-ions. If they are for God or for Baal, they must say so unequivocally. The society, and whatever help they can find in their society, and whatever help they can draw from their purses. The danger attending the first alternative will be the withdrawal of Northern confidence and contributions. As to the latter half the Board can only say for itself how much it values the Christian fellowship of the slavedrivers, but we would most affectionately suggest that the ready money does not come from that quarter of the firmament. We would remind them of the fact in religious statistics, that last year two Presbyterian Churches of this city con-tributed more than twice as much to the cause of missions as the two entire Synods of Virginia and North Carolina! We venture to say that the proportion of contributions to the Tract Society is about the same as in this case. As men of busi-ness, we should advise them to stick by the North, as the best paymaster. But it is for them to choose between the two horns of their own dilemma.
