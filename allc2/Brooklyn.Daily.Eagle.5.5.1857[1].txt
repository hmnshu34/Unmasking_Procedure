	Then as to the practical operation of such a provision.  Must each voter read correctly? or at what point of efficiency can he be considered qualified--and below what point unfit to vote?  Must he talk the language according to the New England intonation and not only speak it but speak it through his nose?  Will it be supposed that he can talk "English" if he says he "reckons" or "calculates" or "guesses" when he means that he thinks or believes?  Must he not only write but write correctly and spell properly?  and is Webster to be the standard in orthography?
	Leaving these branches connected with the practical operation of the subject, consider for a moment the amendment in connection with the course of the Bay State in dealing with other commonwealths.  But first, we desire to say that to compel a man to be able to read the name of the candidate on the ballot he votes, seems to be in itself an entirely unexceptionable demand, and one which any free State has a right to make of its voters.  But it is in Massachusetts and among the politicians of the party which adopts Massachusetts politics that such a course becomes inconsistent and tyrannical.--Massachusetts is never done denouncing the South because there is a class who are denied the exercise of rights, social and political.  And New England politicians favor the admission of this class to the rights of suffrage, and by the Black Republicans in our own State the first steps have been taken to alter the constitution for their admission, simultaneously with the exclusion of illiterate whites in Massachusetts.--The negros are ignorant, and particularly so on political topics; for having been exluded from the exercise of political privileges, and without any expectation of being admitted, they could feel no interest in what they had no concern.--But it is not proposed to demand reading and writing from them as a sine qua non to the right to vote.
