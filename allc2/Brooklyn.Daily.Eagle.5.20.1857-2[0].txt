The Quarantine Difficulties

May 20th, 1857

	The Tribune is actually preaching obedience to law, and to law as law, simply because it is law, and not because it is right or just.  But is has preached rebellion so long, rebelion at home and abroad, in New York and in Kansas, that its conversion on behalf of its Black Republican usurpers will have little effect.  It holds that the new Police District is necessary in case of riots outside of the cities, such as the burning of the Quarantine grounds.  There is not a doubt that if the Black Republican Legislature succeeds in establishing a standing army, they will be able to keep it in work.  The Quarantine commissioners could not secure any ground at Seguine's Point for Quarantine purposes, but by the aid of a speculator who induced a man to sell his property on the representation that it was to be a site for a villa residence.  And this miserable, cheat, swindle and false pretence which would send a pickpocket to the Penitentiary, was used to plant a plague spot on the property of people who would have rejected millions, sooner than have the cholera or yellow fever at their door posts.  Instead of the people being restrained in preventing the consummation of the swindle, its perpetrators ought to be properly punished for the fraud.
	The fact is, if the Black Republicans reign much longer they will require the largest standing army they can organize.  They will goad the people to rebellion all over the State, and will require the bayonets and musketry to keep them in awe.
