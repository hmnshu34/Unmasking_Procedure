Wednesday, September 9, 1857. Our State and City Elections-False Issues and the True Issue. Our contemporaries of this city in the interest of the Albany oligarchy, have simultaneously opened their batteries against Mayor Wood, and if we may believe them, Fernando Wood is the most infamous wretch outside of the prison walls of Sing Sing-the author of all our excessive taxations-the source of all the knavery among our rascally plotting politicians of all parties-the chief of the “Dead Rabbits”-the inventor of the potato rot, and in fact the very box of Pandora, from which have been showered upon us all the political, social and moral evils that afflict our unfortunate people. Consequently, we are told, it becomes the first duty of the people of the city and the State to get rid of this political monster, and to this end the population of the whole commonwealth are called upon to come to the rescue.
Was there ever a more paltry and pitiful specimen of party trickery attempted upon the credulity of any people than this. Fernando Wood is Mayor of the city of New York-he may be again a candidate for this office, and he may not be. If he should not be, what would our black republican dodgers do next? Certainly, sit their powder and shot expended upon Mayor Wood would be ammunition thrown away. But even if nominated again as the democratic candidate for Mayor, how is he in that position to be made the issue for our State election? Should the vote of the state be unanimously cast against him in November, it will not touch his case; which is to be decided upon by the people of this city alone in our local December election. Mayor Wood, therefore, as an issue for our State canvass, is about as applicable to the real exigencies of the occasion as the doings of Governor Walker and the “border ruffians” in Kansas.
