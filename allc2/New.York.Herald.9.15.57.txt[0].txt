Tuesday, September 15, 1857. The Pressure and Panic in the Fashionable World. We have had a good deal to say of late in relation to the pressure and panic in the world of finance, and have been quite curious to see how the miseries of Wall street would operate upon the world of fashion-that world for which we import the laces of Valenciennes, the silks and velvets of Lyons, the bronxes and the Sevres vases, the rich carpets, the fine jewelry and watches, the costly wines and other luxuries for which we have to pay out so many millions of good bard specie money every year. Well, the butterflies who flaunt and flutter about with all these things, have come to town with the mosquitoes; and a fine show they make. The outside pressure and panic which they came in certain quarters are tremendous. The hotels, about midway between the world of business and the world of laziness-the St. Nicholas and Metropolitan-first felt the pressure, being overrun with birds of passage from the watering places and elsewhere. At these hotels all the apartments were crowded, and the rush increasing, the parlors, and even the dining rooms, were made dormitories for the time being-late travellers being obliged to sleep on “cote,” hospital fashion. This pressure afterwards extended to the more retired up town hotels, such as the Brevoort and Clarendon, and even the cool, quiet, breesy corridors of the Everett House have been somewhat invaded by the rush of outside barbarians.
