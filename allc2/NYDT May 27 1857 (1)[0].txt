May 27, 1857
	The year 1857 will be remembered as deficient in one of the seasons. Winter lingered and stormed and frowned until the 21st of May, when Summer at once succeded it. March left us last week, and now we are in the midst of June. Of course, farm-ers are busy as they can be, from the Ottawa to the Everglades, and even in the icy covering of Lake Superior, which was firm at our last advices, has doubtless succumbed to the fervid influence of the last four days. The frost and snow of the late severe Winter, which were present and potent within a week throughout the mountain vales and higher table-lands of our Northern and Eastern States, whave beaten a hasty retreat to the lofty glens of the Rocky Mountains and the shores of Hudson's Bay. The change is all but magical--nay, better than magical--it is Providential. One week since, our farmers were despondently won-dering if the planting season would erer come. Now, except on marshy, wet lands, the husbandman could not ask for influences more genial, more in-viting. "Winter," says an Italian proverb, "never rots in the sky." Let us gratefully rejoice that Summer is equally constant, and that the time and harvest, though restricted, never absolutely fail.
