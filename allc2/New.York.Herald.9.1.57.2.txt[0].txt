Tuesday, September 1, 1857. More Trouble at Tammany. We see that the small politicians of Tammany Hall are still quarrelling about minor matters, and the General Committees show no particular disposition to unite. We shall have to appeal to Mr. Buchanan to turn out all these rebellious office holders-make a clean sweep-and appoint others in their places. Here is an opportunity to carry the city and the State by a union of the democratic party, and, exclusive of the State, the salaries of the local offices to be filled amount to two hundred thousand dollars per annum. Is all this, and the control of the State itself, to be thrown away by some personal quarrels of small potato politicians? The administration has the power to unite the party in this State, and that power should be used without fear or favor. 
One thing, however, is certain: Whatever the result of the Tammany troubles may be, there will be no mistake about one thing: Fernando Wood is the only candidate for the Mayoralty. He is the only man who has the confidence of the democratic masses when they come to talk about a candidate for Mayor. An amusing proof of this fact was given at a meeting lately held under the auspices of the Mayor’s political opponents. When his name is mentioned, it was received with great cheering, thus defeating the real object for which the people were called together. Mayor Wood does not need any General Committee nomination. He will be nominated by a general committee of the masses, who will sweep away all the party machinery, which has become a nuisance. The small politicians will please take notice, and govern themselves secondly.
