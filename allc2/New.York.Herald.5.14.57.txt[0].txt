Thursday, May 14, 1857. Kansas! Kansas!-Glorious News!-Governor Walker’s New Programme. With mingled emotions of confidence, satisfaction, resignation, hope and enthusiasm we disclose to the American people this day the new, the simple, but grand and comprehensive programme of Hon. Robert J. Walker for the pacification of Kansas. We obtain it from a highly respectable and reliable source, and, in good faith and with great pleasure we hasten to law it before our world of readers. Read our special dispatch from Washington. Read it, fellow citizens, digest it, and trust in the future.
We have seen, from the reception given to Secretary Stanton in Kansas, how the land lies and how the wind blows in that quarter. But he has, nonetheless, fulfilled his mission in stirring up the animals. Their growling and groaning responses have given the desired information at headquarters; for thus Mr. Stanton has revealed the important fact that it will be madness to attempt to thrust the bogus laws of the Territory down the throats of the people, inasmuch as neither in the disguise of buttered parsnips, nor with threats of the bayonet, will the free State rebels swallow these obnoxious local laws. Accordingly, Mr. Walker has been studying out some new plan for the settlement of the slavery question, for the pacification and reconciliation of all parties in Kansas through the next COngress, and for the preservation in the interval of peace of the Territory. These great objects are worthy the highest ambition; and he that shall achieve them may command the highest rewards.
