	But there is really no inconsistency in the effort to elevate blacks and depress whites.  The action in both cases springs from the same principle.  Puritanical presumption of superior gifts and godliness seizes hold of the negro because he enables them to denounce and vilify the South and indirectly hold forth their own superior virtue and humanity, while a few illiterate whites among themselves being depressed and branded as an inferior class afford a standing illustration of the aristocratical superiority of their oppressors.  Persecution is inherent in the Puritan element.  Its form differs with the spirit of the age.  Faggots and cat-o'-nine-tails went out of use with witchcraft and regractory Quakerism ; and now insulting epithets flung at the South and the ink-horn and spelling-book are the mild manifestations of the same innate principle.  That a man should be born with a black skin is his misfortune, not his fault, and that a white should have been denied opportunites of acquainting himself with the English language is also his loss and not his fault.  And the best intellects and lawgivers have been men more read in human nature and the character of their fellows than in books.  A man may read all the trash that issues from a  press, all the spiritual literature and clairvoyant philosophy, and be a great fool  And while education is the corner-stone of a Republic, the old proverb still holds good, that "one ounce of mother-wit is better than a pound of learning."
