	But the cause of these frequent bursts is traceable beyone newspaper lists, and will not cease by their being gazetted.  The undue extension of the credit system is what leads to such bubble blowing among the merchants, particularly those who deal in drygoods and other light fabrics.-- Dealers make purchases ten times above the amount of their capital and pay high prices for the credit.  Rapid sales being unnecessary, these are made recklessly, and when one has got as far as he can reach and falls, he is sure to shake a dozen and probably bring some of them to the ground.
	No doubt many start with fraudulent intent, and take advantage of bankruptcy to cheat creditors ; but while such trade is carried on by means of such extensive credit as prevails, honest dealers will often be forced to capitulate, for the system places them at the mercy of the dishonest members.
	The farmer buys on credit and mortgages his crop in advance ; the retailer who supplies him buys on credit from the city merchant, and the latter's business stands on the same bottom.  Hence any one prop being removed the whole topples over.  If the cash principle prevailed there might be less tawdry gewgaws exhibited by vulgar slaves of fashion, but there would be fewer banckruptcies and less dishonesty.
	If people had to pay cash for what they purchase, unnecessary expenditures and those beyond their means would be checked ; but when payment is put away in the distance it loses its formidable dimensions, and the desire to flourish and shine in the mean time, and trust to something to turn up, overbalances prudence and sensible calculations.  Credit is essential to business, but it should be handled sparingly, for otherwise it will be sure to explode.
