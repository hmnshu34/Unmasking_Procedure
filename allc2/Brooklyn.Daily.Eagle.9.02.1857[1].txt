	In our report of the proceedings of the City Committee last night, it will be seen that a motion was carried to have the Ward Committees nominate Inspectors of Election, subject to the approval of the City Committee delegates.-- Now we can see no reason why the City Committee delegates should have any power to interfere in the matter and if any General Committee is to exercise such power, matters may just as well remain as they are.  The members of the City committee were never elected to do any such duty.
	Every member of a political party is expected to vote for the candidates of that party, provided, however, he and every other member has had a fair opportunity to express his preference for any candidates he may have desired to see in the field.
