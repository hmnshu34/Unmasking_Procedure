As a candidate for Mayor of this city, it was the scandalous abuse heaped upon Fernando Wood by his political enemies that elected him. The public sympathy always inclines in favor of that man who is lucky enough to become the target of malicious and unscrupulous partisan hue and cry of “traitor,” “scoundrel,” “villain,” “forger,” “thief,” “vagabond,” “ruffian,” &c. In this way the foolish and reckless of the political enemies of Fremont, Know-Nothing and democratic, came within an inch of making him President of the United States last November, establishing in his behalf, in a few short months, a personal popularity without a parallel in the nineteenth century. In the same way this unstinted personal abuse of Mayor Wood is making a great man of him among the people, upon the popular idea that the apple tree, of all the orchard, which has the most sticks and stones among its branches, is that upon which the best fruit is most likely to be found.
Sadly put to it as are our Seward oligarchy for “a good enough Morgan till after the election,” Mayor Wood will not answer their purpose. He has done nothing requiring a popular revolution to put him down-he has no despotic power which it is necessary to take away in order to restore to the people these rights and immunities of which they have been robbed. As Mayor of the city he has been reduced to the position of a mere servant of an Albany board of overseers; and for this degradation of our local chief magistrate, it is not Mayor Wood, but the Seward spoils and plunder jobbers at Albany that are responsible. Mayor Wood is only a prominent municipal victim of the usurpations of our last Seward Legislature; and if from some unlucky accident he were to perish to-day, our position as the people of a great city, under the control of an Albany board of overseers, would not be improved in the slightest degree.
