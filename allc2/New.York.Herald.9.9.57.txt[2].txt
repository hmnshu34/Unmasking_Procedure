The Kansas letter of Mr. Buchanan has effectually silenced the shrieking and howling of our Seward demagogues over “bleeding Kansas,” and now, in turning from “bleeding Kansas” to Mayor Wood, as an electioneering issue for our November canvass, they betray the essential weakness of their real position and the fate which awaits them in the election. The real issue upon which the people of this city and State will be called upon to vote in November is either “bleeding Kansas” or Mayor Wood, but it is the spoils and lobby-jobbing Legislature of our Seward lawmakers at Albany; and the question he decided in November is not who shall to our Mayor elected in December; but it is simply his-shall the despotic, corrupt and demoralising measures of our last Legislature be repealed, or endorsed and extended by the next?
Upon this practical question, comprehending the municipal rights of our towns and cities, our corporation and State taxes, the disbursement of the public money, the reformation of existing abuses, State and cooperative, we anticipate a popular revolution in November which will teach our Seward spoils and plunder demagogues a wholesome and enduring lesson. Meantime, let our Seward organs continue their Billingsgate against Mayor Wood, and revive their lamentations over “bleeding Kansas” if they can. With the practical opening of the State campaign they will very soon discover which way the wind is blowing.
