The rejection of the amended Dallas-Clarendon treaty by Lord Palmerston, continues, according to our telegraphic advices, the ruling topic in diplomatic and political circles at Washington. Lord Napier, it seems, was no less surprised at this sudden change in the wind across the water than was the President and his Cabinet. We are further advised that Mr. Buchanan is by no means satisfied with the reasons, explanations and conjectures he has been favored with concerning the rejection by Lord Palmerston of this amended treaty. We dare say, however, that before another month shall have elapsed, our Cabinet will not only be favored with the lifting of the curtain, and a front view of the principal actors on the stage, but with some valuable glimpses of the machinery and operators behind the scenes. 
We apprehend that enough has already been done to kill off effectually this Dallas-Clarendon treaty, is any shape in which many now be worked up by either side. It will also, we fear, prove to be a waste of labor, time and diplomacy to attempt any new negotiations upon the basis of a joint protectorate over the Nicaragua route, and the States near or through which it passes. Within a few months the British Cabinet seem to have repeated of their last summer’s magnanimity in regard to Honduras and the Bay Islands; and we think it will very shortly appear that Palmerston’s present resolution is to hold fast to that group of islands and the main land adjacent thereto, with a view to the absolute possession and control of a transit passage between the two oceans in that neighborhood. Doubtless, too, Lord Palmerston has adopted this course as providing a check for the future against any over ambitious American filibustering in Central America and the West India islands.
