What are the consequences of the recent unfortunate appointments (with the exception of Mr. Schell) made by the new administration? We have already a new and fatal division in the democratic party, and two general committees, representing two distinct organizations, claim possession of Tammany Hall. Mr. Sickles, while in the Senate last winter, aided and abetted the black republicans in passing those atrocious enactments of which the people of this city now complain, and which were intended to place the government of this city in the bands of Thurlow Weed and his friends. Mr. Sickles and his friends raised the excitement at Tammany Hall, and brought in all the black republican seceders to oust the General Committee chosen by the democrats at the regular election last year. There is division and disunion and recrimination and violence and fighting among the democracy, on account of the unfortunate appointments at the Custom House; and the row between Murphy and Sickles at Willardâ€™s Hotel, Washington, will soon be renewed at Tammany Hall, at the Pewter mug, and in every ward of this city, with the clenched fists, furious voices and other demonstrations of the excited democracy.
The only chance for harmony and union at Tammany depends upon the moderation and wisdom of the new Collector-Mr. Schell-when he takes possession of his office. If he allows the same councils to prevail with him that have been powerful at Washington, and which have already made a new split, then it is all over with the democracy of the city and State.
