Publishing Bankruptcies

May 20th, 1857

	Quite an animated discussion is going on in the newspapers on the propriety of publishing the bankruptcies and suspensions which occur among business men.  On one side it is urged that such publication prevents those who find it necessary to suspend from being able to recover their lost ground and overcome the temporary embarrassment which they would be able to do if their difficulties were not exposed ; for as soon as it is known that they are likely to fail creditors rush in their accounts and debtors fail to present theirs, knowing that no further credit or commercial advantage will result from promsitude.
	On the other hand it is held that the publication prevents voluntary bankrupts, who, representing themselves to be worth a large amount, get into debt for goods which they sell out cheap for cash, pocket the lion's share of the proceeds, and divide the balance among their creditors at the rate of about twenty cents on the dollar.-- Thousands, it is said, "will be impelled by a salutary fear of this national pillory to pay their debts and maintain their credit unimpaired; who have shaved one set of creditors nearly to the bone will be disabled by it from walking promptly into affections of another set.  The publication does good every way, and must be continued.  The honest bankrupts need not be ashamed of his misfortune; the rogue should be made ashamed of his knavery.  Publicity is the true touchstone."
