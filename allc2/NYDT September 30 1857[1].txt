       I. We owe Five Hundred Millions of Dollars to Europe, on which there is accuring an annual in-terest of at least Thirty-five Millions. To meet this interest and pay off one-twentieth part of the principal annually, would require an excess of Ex-ports over Imports for the next ten year of at least Fifty Millions per annum.
       II. Our low Revenue Tariff and our expanded Paper Currency conspire to swell our Imports and diminish our Exports, so that, during the last year, our Imports exceeded our Exports, other than Specie, by more than Fifty Millions. The Cus-tom-House returns indicate a payment in full or the balance by the export of more than Fifty Millions in Speciel but we do positively know that we con-tinued to sell to Europe Railroad Bonds and State Stocks throughout the year, thereby increasing our indebtedness to the amount of many Millions. For, our Exports being nearly all sent to countries which charge Specific Duties, while our Imports are assessed Ad Valorem, or according to their ap-praised or invoiced value, there is a constant and powerful temptation to invoice our Imports at the lowest possible prices, while our Exports are in-voiced at their full value. We have no doubt, therefore, that the Three Hundred and Fifty Mill-ions’ worth of Foreign Merchandise that we im-ported during the last fiscal year actually cost us at least Four Hundred Millions (more than One Million per day for the entire year,) and that we were in debt to Europe at the close of the year, after exporting the Fifty Millions of Gold we dug in California and some Millions more, at least Fifty Millions more than when the year opened. And the reduced rates of duty just established by Congress tend still further to stimulate Importa-tion and increase our Foreign indebtedness.
