The Savings Banks

September 30th, 1857

	The present state of the financial world will render us less disposed to ridicule the banking system practised by the good old Dutch farmers, who, when they became possessed of surplus cash, invested it, not in fancy stocks, but carefully tied up in the heel of a stocking and deposited under a brick in the chimney corner.-- The financier who made such a disposition of his money might not draw large dividends or usurious interest ; but neither would he be in danger of both interest and principal disappearing in the absorbing vortex of a financial crisis.  It would be always safe and sure to his hand when he required it.
	Of all modern receptacles of money, that which is surest and best, that which unites the safety of the heel-stocking bank, with the profit which the possessor of money has a right to expect, is the Savings Bank.  Here it is that the great mass of people who can afford to save small sums from time to time, can find a safe, sure, and profitable investment.  The mechanic or working man who can save but a dollar a week may secure shelter against a rainy day, by opening an account with the Savings Bank.  Having once commenced, he will always be anxious to increase the amount, and will be less open to the thousand humbugs and swindles intended to coax the money out of his pocket.
