We have reason to believe that there will be no permanent obstacle in the way of a purchase of Sandy Hook, if the regulation with the Jerseys be undertaken in a proper manner and a good spirit. If the right men are sent to Trenton, and a business negotiation set on foot with the people of Monmouth county, the matter will become sooner or later a mere question of money, and no sum would be too great for so vast a boon as the removal of Quarantine out of reach of the city. All the obduracy and unbending hostility which were evinced by the Jersey Legislature were brought out by the very silly-if honest-course pursued by the New York negotiators.
For the present, we see that the Commissioners say that they are resolved to pursue their undertaking, build their fever depot, and use it all the year. On the other hand, the people of Princeâ€™s Bay make no secret of their intended resistance; the Jerseymen, we understand, whose homes and business would be utterly ruined by the schemes of the COmmissioners, have threatened the lives of noy persons who venture to bring yellow fever patients thither. It would be highly desirable for this quarrel to be adjusted before the hot weather is upon us. It will not do to risk yellow fever patients to a place where they may be burned in their beds by desperate men. And if it be true that all this trouble and danger have been the fruit of corrupt speculations in real estate, one can well understand that the indignation of the sufferers should know no bounds.
