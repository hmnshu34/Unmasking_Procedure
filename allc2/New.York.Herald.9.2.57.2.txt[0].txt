Wednesday, September 2, 1857. Departure of Chevalier Wikoff for Europe-His Mission. Amongst the passengers for Europe by the Jason, to-day, is that distinguished diplomat, politician, liberateur, amateur journalist and carper knight-the Chevalier Wikoff. He returns to the Old World laden with honors. During his last visit to us he has left a busy, and, we believe, a profitable life. To sum up in a few words the results of his achievements, he has published an American edition of his “Roving Diplomatist,” harmonized the tractions rump of the democracy, patronized the dinners of our Fifth avenue millionaires, broken the hearts of half a dozen of our fashionable belles, and finally carried away with him a hoet of agreeable, social and political souvenirs, which he will no doubt give to the world in some future publication. 
Some of our contemporaries, who profuse to be intimately acquainted with the Chevalier’s secrets, and who have chronicled his movements with the fidelity of the Court newsman, have from time to time announced his appointment to various important posts. At one time he was said to be nominated to the Consulship at Paris; at another to that of London more recently still, to the higher diplomatic appointment at Berlin. A venerable daily, which devotes itself to the solution of scientific problems, undertook to explain the mysterious variety of these rumors by the announcement that he was to be entrusted with the important mission of regulating all our foreign legations, and of posting up our ministers on their duties and responsibilities. Now, we do not for a moment doubt the capacity of the Chevalier for each and every one of those posts, and still less do we doubt his readiness to accept of them. The man who, under Lord Palmerston, undertook to preserve the peace of the world must feel himself equal to anything, and Wikoff is not a man to belle his destiny.
