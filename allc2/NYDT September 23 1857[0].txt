	If the question of the suppression of gambling in stocks by time sales related only to the person composing the Board of Brokers and their satellite of the curbstone, it would be a matter of but very little consequence. Three or four hundred persons, or twice that number, if only their own fortunes were involved, might gamble to their heart’s con-tent without any serious injury to the community. But then we must consider that the men of the Stock Exchange are representative men. They act not merely nor mainly for themselves, but to a much larger extent for that great mass of the com-munity known among them as outsiders. They may be, in fact, jointly and severally compared to the keepers of a gambling house, who only gamble themselves by way of leading on the frequenters of their establishment, greenhorns and others, to do the same thing. The Stock Exchange is a great gambling-house in which the business is carried on by attorney, and very often by parties whose par-ticipation in the game is unknown to their closest business connections. This evil is well known to have spread to a frightful extent, and this explains why the panic in the stock market and the fall of stocks has communicated itself so rapidly and with much intensity to the great body of the business classes. Nor is the trouble limited merely to those who have gambled and have lost. By the universal distrust to which it has given rise it affects every-body, even those who never in their lives bought or sold a share of stock of any kind, if, in-deed, any such persons are to be found among those engaged in business in this city.
