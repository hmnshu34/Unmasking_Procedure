	In the Anniversaries this week celebrated in our City are collected and represented very much of the Religion and Philanthropy of the American People. It were easy to cavil at the specific objects or measures of one or another of the associations thus challenging public attention and sympathy—to show that this one expends too much, or that one effects too little—that the next might find a more worthy or practicable aim, while another might gain its end more surely or swiftly by other agencies or a different policy than that which it has chosen—but no one can considerately doubt the beneficent gen-eral influence of these organizations and their ef-forts. If they do not in all cases help the objects of their solicitude, they can hardly fail to benefit their supporters. Every human being is made better by his every unselfish endeavor to enlighten or bless others, and especially the distant, the be-nighted, the despised. It is easy to sneer at the philanthropy which seeks its beneficiaries at the ends of the earth; but are the sneerers more likely than the sneered at to relieve that virtuous need that clusters and shivers around their own door-steps? If all the Foreign Missions, so generously impelled and sustained in this country, were proved to have never converted one heathen, we should still deem their cost fully repaid in their necessary influence in diffusing sentiments of humanity and mercy among our own people. Striving to do good to others is the sure way to loving them, and to a vital perception that they, with us, are the unfail-ing objects of Divine care and beneficence.
