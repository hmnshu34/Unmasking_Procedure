Wednesday, September 2, 1857. The Secession Presbyterian Convention at Richmond. The Convention at Richmond of the seceders from the General Assembly of the New School Presbyterian church held some time since at Cleveland, Ohio, has reached its third day, and the proceedings promise to be continued for several days longer. 
It will be remembered that the General Assembly convened at Cleveland passed certain resolutions, by which the holding of slaves was declared to be anti-Christian and contrary to the doctrines of the Presbyterian church. This course at once placed all the members of that church who reside in the slave States without its pale, and the result has been that these have met in Convention, in order to prepare a Presbyterian platform on which they can stand, and to call a regular General Assembly for the purpose of organizing the government of their churches. The call for this Convention, which we published yesterday in the report of the second day’s proceedings, is a very temperate and modest document. It sets out with the declaration that the action of the Cleveland Assembly on the subject of slavery shows that peace and harmony can no longer prevail in that body, and requires the organization of another Assembly, in which the agitation of the slavery question will be unknown. It goes on to argue that the Cleveland Assembly has declared slaveholding to be a sin in the sight of God and an offence in the sense of the constitution of the church, although there is not the most remote allusion to it in the standards of the church; that it regards this action of the Assembly as a palpable violation of the spirit and letter of its constitution, involving an ecclesiastical despotism as tyrannical as that of Rome; it declares that is hold the introducers of this vexed question as alone responsible for the consequences of the division of the church; and, finally, calls all constitutional Presbyterians who oppose such an agitation in the church to meet in the present Convention at Richmond.
