	In the good old days of the rotten boroughs, the cry of the borough-mongers used to be, “May not “a man do what he will with his own?” But the Reform Bill came along and bothered the owners of this “peculiar species of property,” as they call slaves at the South. The property of a great lord in his parson used to be regarded as perfect as that in the free and independent voters in his borough. He had made him, or, at least, given him his living if not his life, and it was his duty to exercise his clerical function to suit his patron as much as it was that of the tenants to use their political fran-chise to please the landlord. A jury, we see, has been interfering with this prerogative appurtenant to the advowson, at Elvaston, Derbyshire, where the Earl of Harrington has a castle and a manor. The vicar of the parish , the Rev. Mr. Highmore, sued the Earl and his Countess for slander, consist-ing of certain defamatory statements touching his character made by the right honorable lady of the manor and wife of the patron of the living. The Earl—who was better known in the days of the Regency, of Lord Byron, of Major Pendenmis and the Marquis of Steyne, before Brummell was “dished” or Long Pole Wellesley “diddied,” as the Hon. Colonel Leicester Stanhope—was joined in the action as the husband responsible for the damages done by his wife’s tongue. His lordship has of later days been more creditably known as the advocate of the Maine Liquor Law in the House of Lords, as a patron of Father Matthew, and a friend of the Temperance cause generally.
