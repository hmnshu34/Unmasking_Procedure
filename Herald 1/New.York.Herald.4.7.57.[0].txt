Tuesday, April 7, 1857. Walker’s Late Successi-His Splendid Prospects-What Will the Administration Do? We perceive that the attention of the administration has been recalled to the affairs of Nicaragua by the late victorious operations of Walker and Henningsen, and that the Cabinet have been agitating the policy of sending down a Minister to look up the Nicaraguan government. As yet Mr. Buchanan has taken no step indicating his purposes in reference to this Nicaragua squabble; but we expect that his policy in the appointment of a Minister will be the recognition of the local government de facto,  Walker’s though it should be. As for poor Pierce, his Central American proceedings, like his correo upon Kansas affairs, were “neither fish, flesh, fowl nor red herring.” He was afraid on Tuesday of the thing done on Monday, and on Wednesday of the blunder of Tuesday, and so on from day to day, from week to week, from month to month, from year to year, to the end of the chapter.
Now, Mr. Buchanan, though a cautious man, has the character of a straight-forward man in his private and in his official conduct. Accordingly, when we hear that he has been considering the question of a new Minister to Nicaragua, we take it for granted that his mind has been acting upon a certain theory of facis, events and probable results, and that his action will conform to this theory. We dare say that he is not ignorant of the means, resources and capabilities of Walker, and that the administration is not pre-committed to the allies. But, whatever may be the views and inclinations of Mr. Buchanan, we suspect that it will not be much longer before they assume an efficient and practical shape.
