Tuesday, May 5, 1857. Strange Love Affair in Indiana-Peculiar Interview Between Lovers-Tragedy. The Liberty Herald, printed at Liberty, Union county, tells the following- We have been placed in possession of some most melancholy facts in relation to a young man and a young lady, the former a resident of Pleble county, Ohio, and the latter a resident of Oxford. It appears that the young gentleman is a student at West Point Military Academy, and the lady was his betrothed. Being absent from her for a long while, he returned home some two weeks since, and found her married and in her second confinement. Although a correspondence had been regularly kept up between them, she had concealed the fact of her marriage, and of course he was startled to find how matters stood in his return. The young man wisely determined to let matters pass off quietly, and seek friends and fortune in another place. In view of this determination he concluded not to see the lady, but unwise counsels of friends prevailed with him, and he went to the house where she resided. While in a room adjoining that of a lady, she heard and recognized his voice, and expressed a desire for an interview with him. He immediately repaired to the room, where a most affecting messe occurred. She asked and obtained his pardon; the interview closed, and they separated. But what she had passed through was beyond her power of endurance, and that night her spirit passed from earth. The young man was not informed of her death until morning when he attempted self destruction by jumping into a mill race not far from where he resided. He would have succeeded in drowning himself but for the accidental appearance of a gentleman winding his way along the race to the mill. Immediately after he was taken from the water and resuscitated, his friends sent him to Cincinnati, where we would be away from the scenes that would bring to his memory the unhappy circumstances which had overtaken him at his house.
