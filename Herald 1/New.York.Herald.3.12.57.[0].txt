Tuesday, March 12, 1857. Administration of Criminal Justice. We have frequently been obliged to criticise with some severity the mal-administration of criminal justice in this city, especially in the lower courts. So lax had some of the Judges become that they were presented and indicted by the grand inquest of the country, and it had become a grave question in the minds of many liberal men whether or not the systems of electing Judges ought to be abolished. During all this time crime was steadily on the increase; and to read the daily accounts of assaults, robberies, garrotings, and so forth, a stranger would have supposed that he was sojourning in a camp of savages instead of a city presumed to be free and enlightened. But since Mr. Justice Russell has taken his place on the bench of the Sessions as City Judge, a marked change is noticeable. He has discharged his duties with promptness, impartiality and dignity. “It is a hard thing,” said a convict to a celebrated English jurist, “to hang a man for stealing a horse.” “You are not,” returned the Judge, “to be hanged for stealing a horse: you are to be hanged that no more horses will be stolen.” This is the whole theory of criminal law in an epigram. In his severe sentences against the convicted garroters, Judge Russell has recognized the force of the theory. A man is not sentenced to the State prison for life because he robbed another of a few dollars, but in order that no more persons shall suffer in a similar way. Judge Russell has also been prompt. At Special Sessions be disposed of seventy cases in one day. He does not allow the cases to linger along until the accused slips out on straw bail, and is unheard of till he is brought to the bar charged with some fresh crime.
