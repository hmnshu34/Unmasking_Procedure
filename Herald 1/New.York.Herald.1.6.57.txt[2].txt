The course of this great movement upon this continent is apparent to every thinker. Arizona, just budding into life, will soon build the Pacific Railroad with the mineral wealth now hidden in its bosom. No aid need be sought from Congress; no scheme of plunder of the public lands combined. The Isthmus routes, too, bringing the immense commerce of the Pacific to the doors of our New York merchants, enter largely into it. But perhaps, above all in value to our own commerce, are the dormant resources of Mexico. When once Anglo-Saxon energy shall bare been applied to them, and our intelligence and our enterprise carried there to establish good government and safety for individual possession, the commerce of our city will again double in eight years, and perhaps even less, and the whole world be benefitted by the change. 
Events are now preparing for this result in Mexico. Comonfort has struck a deathblow to that nightmare of his country, the church organization, and now seems about receiving his own coup de grace from the enemies that have sprung up on all sides around him. He has prepared the way in some measure, and wishing to tread it himself, seeks Anglo-Saxon counsel and aif from our government. Whether he receive it or not, Anglo-Saxon energy and enterprise must go there, and will. With a true appreciation of our own interests, we say let it go, and the sooner the better. It is part of the territorial extension of the realm of King Commerce.
