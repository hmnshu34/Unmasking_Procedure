Since he returned to Scotland, he appeared to be of the opinion that his crowning feat in Canada was the passage of the Reciprocity treaty with this country, Some loose expressions of his are quoted from some speech, amounting to a sort of assertion that he had got the better of our negotiators in that matter. We know not how this is, and are inclined to think Lord Elgin much too prudent a man to make any such remarks; but one thing we do know, and that is that our government at Washington does openly pique itself on having outwitted Lord Elgin and the Canadians in this same Reciprocity matter. It is pretty safe to assume that nobody can be very badly swindled since both parties claim to have been the swindlers. 
We hope Lord Elgin may come to this country. He is a man of hard, practical, common sense. Though a Peer of England-to which dignity he was elevated after the successful result of his administration in Canada-he is a thorough democrat in his ideas and notions, and would, were he at Washington, be hail fellow well met in a month with with every member of Congress and every head of department in the country. He is, moreover, a good lawyer and a shrewd diplomatists; were he on the ground, we suspect that the intrigues of the Russian and French embassies would be very rapidly brought to a close, and that the course of opinion in Washington would not be, as it has been lately, persistently hostile to england.
