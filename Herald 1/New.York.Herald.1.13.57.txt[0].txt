Tuesday, January 13th, 1857. More Libel Suits-More Theatricals. The philosophers and politicians are not going to have all the fun and expense of bringing suits against libellers, notwithstanding the fact that Greeley has brought three or four suits against the country editors who have charged him with taking bribes at Washington and New York-the latter in Mariposa stock, which is no bribe at all-the stock being worthless. No, the good things of this life are not so unequally distributed as to give all the luxury of bringing suits for libel to the philosophers and politicians. We learn that the chivalrous husband of the fair dilettante who lately appeared at the Buffalo theatre, will proceed immediately to the west, and bring suits for libel against each of the five editors, proprietors and critics of the five daily newspapers, which have a circulation varying from five to fifteen hundred each. Here will be amusement and business enough for the public and the lawyers of Buffalo for some time to come. Mr. Mcmahon is himself a member of the bar. He has had many years’ practice, by which he has realized a large fortune in addition to the handsome competence brought to him by his fair partner, which enables them both to live in elegant style within hail of the Fifth avenue. Mr. McMahon has the reputation of being an excellent special pleader, and understands exactly how to proceed against the five delinquent critics so as to make them smart before he has done with them, and teach the press of the interesting city of Buffalo some principles of good manners, just criticism, knowledge of the stage and gallantry to a far defilante.
