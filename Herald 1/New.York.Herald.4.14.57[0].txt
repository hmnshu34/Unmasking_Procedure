Tuesday, April 14, 1857. The Anti-Slavery Triumph in St. Louis. A great deal of nonsense has lately been published with regard to the recent local election in St. Louis, Missouri, where the anti-slavery ticket triumphed over the pro-slavery candidate. There is nothing wonderful in the result of that election. With the latitude and longitude, soil and climate in Missouri, free labor must eventually drive slave labor farther South. We reason from the examples of Illinois and Indiana, where the land is cut up into town lots and small farms for a free white working population. The holders of large tracts become rich in a day, while the small farmer reaps a competence from his labor. It will be the same in Missouri, which will be filled with free white farmers, increasing the value of town property and small farms, and stimulating all sorts of real estate speculations. Thus free white labor will have a value far beyond that of slave labor, which latter is more suitable for a warmer climate-a climate unpleasant to the white laborer. The State of Missouri is undergoing a change which grows out of natural principles and which will gradually make it a free State. The institution of slavery will not be injured by the change in localities where it is profitable, and none but rabid politicians need fly into a passion about such a tribe as the St. Louis election, which has only a social bearing. There Is no danger that South Carolina or Louisiana will ever undergo the change which is inevitable in Missouri.
