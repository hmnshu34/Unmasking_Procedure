Tuesday, March 3, 1857. Theatrical Criticisms-Is it Venal or Not? Now that the Washington Investing Committee has wound up its labors, and two or three members, with itching palms, have retired from the service of an ungrateful country, the attention of the public has been directed to similar matters in the world of art. Mrs. McMahon has made another speech at Boston of the same tenor as two which have preceded it from the same person. She reiterates the statement that she might have been puffed in the papers if she had seen fit to pay for it--not being disposed to subsidize the Puritan critics, she was unequivocally damned. She, however, states that she intends to imitate the glorious example of Mr. Brown, the persevering hero of one of the gems of the colored opera, and never give it up so. Along with this statement of Mrs. McMahon’s, we have another from the Hon. Booby Brooks, who says, in the Express, that the agents of Miss Matilda Heron subsidized the press of this city at the expense of some three hundred dollars. The matter has been still further complicated by the commencement of a libel suit by one of the critics against one of the managers. The manager publishes a bulletin containing his bills and puffs of the performance, which have been made a little more piquant by personal attacks on the offending critic. He has been denounced as incompetent and venal; accused of seeking to break down one theatre in order to build up another. The manager will have an opportunity to justify his statements; if he does so there is no libel about the matter.
