In the case of Mrs. McMahon we have her own word that she might have had good notices by paying for them. In the case of Miss Heron we see her suddenly inundated by an avalanche of unqualified praise, which astonishes the editors of the provincial papers, who never before knew that they had enjoyed during several years a great theatrical luxury, from which the New York public was debarred. We see one Wall street journal absolutely forgetting stocks and giving to this newly discovered high priestess in the temple of Melpomene an extra, with two leaded columns half a mile long. The little cars of the Sunday press whine gently, making a sweet folletto to the profound bass of the bug doger of the dailies. What is the cause of this charming unanimity? The Hon. Booby Brooks, whose experience in all such operations is something wonderful, says it is three thousand dollars. Brooks ought to know.
On the other side it is held that the accusations are groundless, and that the HERALD is venal in its criticisms of public amusements because bills are posters announcing concerts, operas, theatrical entertainments, &c, are printed in our office. In regard to this, it must be apparent that a contract for job printing is for labor actually performed. It is exactly the same as advertising, for which the full value of the money paid is returned in the publicity given. There is no more venality about printing the bills then there is in printing the advertisements, and whether we print their bills or not makes no difference in our opinions as to the merits or demerits of any actor, actress, singer or manager.
