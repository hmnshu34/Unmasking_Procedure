The effect of all this action on the part of a single Judge, in less than three months, is apparent in the diminution of crime, and the greater security of our streets at night. The garroters have a wholesome terror of the law when properly administered, and have therefore suspended their operations for the present. It were well if all our Judges were as prompt as Abraham D. Russell.
