The advices from Costa Rica, reaching to the 5th from Rivas are more worthy of attention, and it is a little remarkable that they are somewhat more favorable to Walker than those received direct from Nicaragua by the Tennessee. General Belloso, who was besieging Henningsen, writes from Grenada on the 1st that he had not yet been able to bring him to surrender, but that he had got a big gun called Saint Peter to bear upon him, and hoped that would bring him to terms. The Costa Rican accounts do not confirm the story of the massacre of the wounded at Ometepe, but simply that the Indians there had risen against Walker. If such an event as the killing of 200 or 300 of Walker’s wounded men had occurred it is very probable that one Costa Rican would have chronicled it.
The Costa Rican account still further states that Walker had arrived at San Jorge, which was near Rivas, with 400 men, and was about to attack General Canas, who held Rivas with 600 men. This was on the 5th of December, so that we see by this account that Walker was carrying out his plan of attacking Rivas, and that up to the 5th no advices had been received by the Costa Ricans at that place of the surrender of Henningsen. One day would suffice to carry the news from point to point. We may therefore conclude that Walker’s position, however critical it may been was not so critical on the 1st of December as some of our advices by the Tennessee painted it. As for the report that Leon had pronounced in favor of Walker, it requires confirmation. The supposition that Walker would send troops from San Juan del Sur northward to Realejo, the nearest port to Leon, is only a probability, and we so stated it in our review of his position on the arrival of the Tennessee.
