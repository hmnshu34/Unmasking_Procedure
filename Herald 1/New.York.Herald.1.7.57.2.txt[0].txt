Wednesday, January 7th, 1857. Resurrection of the Italian Opera. Mr. Strakosch has published his official announcement conveying to the people of New York and the rest of mankind the pleasing intelligence that he will open the Academy of Music on next Monday week, for representation of Italian Opera. The announcement has created a cheerful sensation in the world of fashion and trade. The dealers in opera cloaks, gloves, lorgnettes, bijouterie, skip like young ladies in the Fifth avenue sing out of tune for joy. Seriously, however, the opening of the Opera House is a good and a pleasant thing, and the new manager has everybody’s best wisher. He must remember that the man who learns wisdom from the experience of other people buys cheaply a valuable commodity, which is usually very expensive. He is perfectly well informed as to the careers of the operatic directors that have preceded him. He will remember that we have had several managers, all of whom ran against some snag or other, and were more or less shipwrecked. Some went down all standing, with total loss of crew and cargo, and no insurance, while others were dismantled and washed ashore in a damaged condition. He will recollect that Sanquirico and Patty failed for want of energy; that Signor Fry went by the board for want of tact, and that Maretzek, intoxication by his partial success, entered the oratorical field and strove to imitate Demosthenes, Cicero and Stephen H. Branch. Mr. Strakosch will do well to avoid all these errors; to attend strictly to his business; to avoid quarrels with his artists, if possible; but by all means to keep his private affairs from the public eye, and above all to make no speeches. By following this advice he may conduct a strictly legitimate, and, we trust, a perfectly successful operatic campaign.
