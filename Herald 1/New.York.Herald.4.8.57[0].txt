Wednesday, April 8, 1857. Mr. Appleton on Newspapers. The Hon. John Appleton, late editor of the Washington Union, left, as a legacy to his readers on quitting that establishment, a little common sense upon the subject of newspapers in the federal capital. The legacy was precious and rare. An idea had prevailed among a certain class or politicians, that the only reason why the Washington Union did not tank rank among newspapers on a level with the New York HERALD was because its editor happened to be a blockhead. This fallacy Mr. Appleton has exploded. He has shown--what it is fallen to our lot to explain more than once-that a great metropolitan newspaper can only be reared in a metropolis; that you can no more build up a first class newspaper in a dull country town like Washington than you can raise an African lion among the ices of the pole. The reason is simple; in a place like Washington, journalistic independence is impossible and without independence, no newspaper can be great. For, in this country, and with our established notions, it is a settled thing that no daily newspaper can support itself by circulation alone; indeed in most cases, there is an actual loss on the daily circulation which is made up otherwise. A paper must, therefore, to live, have other sources of income; and of these sources there is but one that is compatible, with independence, and that is general advertising business, which can only exist, in sufficient amount to be worth consideration, in a great metropolitan city.
