Tuesday, March 10, 1857. Atlantic Telegraph. Orders have been received at the Navy Yard in Brooklyn, from the Secretary of the Navy, to put out at once the United States steamers Niagara and Mississippi to proceed to England to assist in laying down the submarine telegraph cable between Newfoundland and Ireland. The Niagara is the largest steam vessel of way in the world. She is a propellor. The Mississippi is the most powerful paddle wheel steamer in our Navy. The English government will furnish also two large ships of the same character. The Niagara will receive on board at London or Liverpool one half of the cable, and the other half will be put on board the navy propellor. The four ships will then process together to the middle of the Atlantic, where the ends of the cable will be joined, and the propellors will then start in opposite directions-the one for Newfoundland and the other for Ireland-each attended by a paddle-wheeler, so that in case of accident the propellors may be taken in low and proceed en the voyage. We are glad to see that Secretary Donbin has taken such deep interest in the success of this great enterprise as to order at once the finest ships in the American navy for this purpose. We doubt not that the new Secretary of the Navy will see that the ships are gilded out in a manner most creditable to the United States government. No doubt there will be a generous feeling of rivalry between the officers of the British and American ships to see which shall lay his part of the cable in the most perfect manner. It is a sign of advancing civilizations when the ships of war of these two great nations thus meet in midocean, not for naval battle, but in a scapeful effort to join the two hemispheres.
