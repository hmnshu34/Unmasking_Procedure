There is another point in the news from Aspinwall which strikes us, and leads us to believe that Gen. Bellosoâ€™s Saint Peter did not wholly answer his expectations. The British steamer Tharaces left San Juan del Norte on the 20th, and reached Aspinwall on the 22nd of December. Here was an interval of twenty days, during which no communication was received at Greytown from the interior. Had Walker experienced any great reverse in that time the news would probably have been known at Greytown. Under all these circumstances, we think it probable that the next news from Walker may be, in some measure, favorable to him. We may not get it for some days yet, as the Texas, to arrive at New Orleans, would wait at San Juan for the James Adger, which steamer took the passengers to the Tennessee from Norfolk.
