“Another National Anniversary Passed”
	The “Glorious Fourth” is passed and gone. As our readers will have perceived by our own paper of yesterday, and the New York journals of this morning, there was all the usual entertainments, orations, military parades, fireworks, excursions, &c.
The day was one of the finest of the season, neither too hot not too cold, and the evening was fine, affording an excellent opportunity for the various pyrotechnical displays. Any quantity of gunpowder was burst, flags floated from all the mast-heads and from the flag staffs on shore, and in every the celebration was worthy of the occasion. We do not recollect any National Anniversary in a long time that was better kept up.
