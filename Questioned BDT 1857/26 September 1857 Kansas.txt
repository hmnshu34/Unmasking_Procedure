“Kansas”
According to the correspondent of the Tribune, Kansas is doomed to be a Slave State; but this writer has cried “Wolf, Wolf,” so often, when there was no occasion for alarm, that it is doubtful whether he will succeed in giving an effectual warning, even if the danger be actually at hand. Certainly, the tone of the Pro-Slavery leaders, in the few speeches of theirs, which have been published latterly, appears to have lost none of the confidence which betokens inevitable success; and the sudden lull in the storm of indignation raised against Gov. Walker by the secessionists of the South, would seem to imply that the Governor has contrived to satisfy them that he is really working for the interests of slavery.
Yet if, as is asserted by the correspondent above referred to, the number of Free State men in Kansas exceed the Pro-Slavery men as ten to one, there need be no fear of the ultimate destiny of the territory. Slavery cannot exist in any Territory for any length of time, under such adverse influences; and a slave State constitution, if made by fraud and stealth, would be amended by the people in less than three years.
