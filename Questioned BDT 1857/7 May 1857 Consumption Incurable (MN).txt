“Consumption Incurable”
Life Illustrated, Mssrs Fowler and Wells excellent paper, runs full tilt last week against the class called quack advertisers, who profess to supply a sovereign remedy for all the ills of life on receipt of  a dollar in postage stamps, &c., and strongly denounces those papers which, for the sake of the advertisement price, suffer themselves to become media for the exercise of these men’s dishonest vocation.
Among the various advertisers who are selected by Life Illustrated as types of their class, are the “retired physician whose sands of life have nearly run out” (It will be well for his dupes when the said “sands” quite “run out”) and the Scheidam Schnapps man, who asserts that he has “fortunately succeeded in making a discovery in manufacture, by which it is deprived of its acrid and inflammatory properties, and [] perfectly pure.” The only comment vouchsafed on this is, that gin “deprived of its acrid and inflammatory properties” will have ceased to be gin. In regard to the specifics for the alleged cure of consumption and dropsy, Life Illustrated remarks, and it is to this that we wished to call attention:
All physicians know, as do all quacks who fabricate medicines to cure all cases of consumption, that the disease is essentially incurable. They know very well that the disease [] essentially in a disorganization of the [] and is never cured, except in the inci[]. They know very well that the[] not whether the patient can be cured, [] he can live? And on this prolon[] the vital struggle, this ever-hoping [] on the part of  the dying one, is [] the chicanery and diabolical shrewd- [] their trade. Drowning persons will []. They know full well that so [] life-principle lingers in the decay- [], so long will the patient pay out [] for whatever is proffered to him with [] of benefit; and thus the ninety-nine [] New York city, who “positively cure [] and cases of consumption,” know [] well that the nostrum-monger who [] the strongest, and swears to the in-[] of his cure-all the most unconscion-[] attract the most attention and sell [] stuff.
[]-marks we have made in relation to []on will apply also to dropsy. This [] what are called “the worst cases,” []incurable. The dropsical condition [] cases, but the evidence of the last [] of the vital powers, and the final []own of the constitution. Those who [] themselves to b so very anxious to get a little of the [] money before he departs hence.
