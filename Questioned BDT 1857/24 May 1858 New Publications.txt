“New Publications”
“THE BOY-TRAVELLERS IN RUSSIA,” is the title of one of the late publications of Harper & Brother. Though intended for young people, it will probably interest and please many an older head. It takes one, in a lively manner, through the Great Northern Empire, showing the “peculiar institutions” of that land, and introduces the reader to people, climate, incidents, characters, &c., &c., in a rapid and graphic manner—describing St. Petersburgh, Moscow, the journey between, the Kremlin Palace, the great Russian Cathedrals, the Departure of Exiles for Siberia, the journey thither, Russian farm life, the Zingari, Sports in Winter, the entrance of the Czar into Moscow, &c., &c.
“WYOMING, ITS HISTORY, STIRRING INCIDENTS, ROMANTIC ADVENTURES, &C.,” is also a late issue from the Harpers’ establishment. The author is the Rev. George Peck. Its contents are described in its title. It treats of Brant and his tory associates, a great many war incidents of remarkable interest, with many narrations of strange adventures in which the red men bear a prominent part. 
A part of the book is devoted to the narrative of the singular discovery of Francis Slocum, nearly sixty years after she had been Miami Indians. At an advanced age, the mother of several children, a complete daughter of the forest, she was discovered by accident, by a gentleman on official business in the neighborhood. 
Our readers will find this every way as absorbing a narrative as any romance. We shall probably commence it to-morrow.
