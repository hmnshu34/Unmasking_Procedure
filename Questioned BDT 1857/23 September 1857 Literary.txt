“Literary”
We see that a new book by Alexander Smith is soon to be issued. It is to be called “City Poems,” and is to be enriched by a portrait of the author.
Fresh works are promised from Charles Kingsley, Charles Reade, Mrs. Jameson and Mayne Reid.
Redfield is about to issue a beautifully illustrated edition of Poe’s Poems. Poe is slowly becoming appreciated by the mass of readers. In the “inner circles” it has long been acknowledged that in original genius no American writer can be compared with him.
