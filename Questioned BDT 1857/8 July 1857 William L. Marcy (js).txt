8 July 1857
“William L. Marcy”
	This eminent person, so suddenly dead, is to be buried to-day at Albany. His remains now lie in the Capitol, in the largest chamber, whose walls are draped with black. Ex-Presidents, Governors, Councilmen, the Military, and numbers of private citizens, attend the funeral. 
	Mr. Marcy deserves to have his memory kept in honor for many a long year in this country. His position as Secretary of State, under Pierce, was all that saved the credit and almost the solidity of the Confederacy, these past four years. The late President is now confessed on all hands to have been the most absurd and incompetent Chief Magistrate that ever filled the Chair of Washington. Mr. Marcy, every way a superior man—indeed we doubt if America has produced a superior in political clearness and strength—prevented the deplorable consequences of so feeble a national head.
	We wish to be considered as sincerely joining in the respect paid to-day to the fame and name of Wm. L. Marcy.
