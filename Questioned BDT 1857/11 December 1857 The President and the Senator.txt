“The President and the Senator”
Which will recede on the question of the Kansas Constitution, the President or Senator Douglas? The question of submission of the Constitution involves also the submission of one of these magnates to the other. We do not believe that there will be an open split in the ranks of the Democratic party; for Douglas cannot afford to lose the support of the South in 1860, nor can the South, if it does not wish to see its Northern allies revolt, proscribe their leader. It looks as if the cautious old President had blundered for once, in committing himself against the submission of the Lecompton constitution to the people. Senator Douglas has probably concluded that he lost the Cincinnati nomination last year through the fear that his unpopularity in the North had rendered him unavailable as a candidate; and that if he wishes for better success in 1860 he must acquire the reputation for a moderate man meanwhile. The South may rage at him now, but he will be in a position then to dictate terms to them, and to give them the option of nominating him, or rushing to certain defeat with a candidate and on a platform which, disavowing popular sovereignty, will not poll a handful of votes in the North.
For the present, however, the prospect looks dark for the Little Giant. The unopposed reelection of Senator Hunter shows how dominant is the fire-eating section in the South. The spoils journals of New York and Philadelphia dare not oppose the President until his appointments are all made; and the Key Stone Club of Philadelphia, like the Tammany Hall patriots, are busy reading all “traitors”—from Douglas and Forney down to McKeon and Rynders, out of the party.
