“White labor, versus Black labor”
The New Orleans, Charleston, and Richmond organs of the “national democracy” oppose any submission to the people, of the Constitution expected from the Kansas Convention. This we call plastering it on a little too heavy! One would suppose the Kansian population to be a subject race, serfs, villeins—and their high and mighty lords sending down commands to them from the capitals of the slave states.
We like the refreshing openness of the southern character. You know where to find such men—you see what they are after, and prepare to meet them and answer them. Half the battle against the audacious attempt to nationalise slavery is already fought and won, as soon as the three hundred thousand slaveholders candidly promulge their objects.
Whether a pro-slavery constitution be rushed down the stomachs of the people of Kansas, or whether it be submitted to the inhabitants of that territory for their fiat, the great cause of American White Work and Working People, will eventually gain, from either contingency. If the constitution be indeed formed upon the wishes of the people, no doubt or shadow of doubt clouds the prospects of the White race. But if slavery is put through under Buchanan, as it was under Pierce, the radical revolution in American politics will be sterner and more summary. The Black cause will enjoy a fleeting triumph in Kansas, only to set in eternal darkness there—to be reprobated all over the North and West—and to be barred out indignantly from all fresh American States.
