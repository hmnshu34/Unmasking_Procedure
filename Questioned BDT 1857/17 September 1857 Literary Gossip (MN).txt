“Literary Gossip”
LITERARY GOSSIP.—We learn that the New Boston Magazine so long in contemplation, will appear on the 1st of November next. It is to be called “The Atlantic Monthly.” The name of the editor has not been made public; but it is understood that Mr. Phillips, the senior member of the firm of Phillips, Sampson & Co., who are to publish the magazine, will assume that post. A very attractive list of contributors is presented, among whom are Prescott, Emerson, Hawthorne, Motley, Longfellow, Lowell, Whittier, Edmund Quincy, Mrs. Stowe, Mrs. Gaskell, Ruffini and Shirley Brooke.
MR. THACKERAY’S NEW NOVEL—The Southern Literary Messenger, in some comments on a work upon which Mr. Thackeray, it is understood, is engaged, entitled “The Virginian,” says it has reason to believe that this work will have no reference to the Virginia of our day, which Mr. Thackeray saw in part, on both his visits to America, but that it will be a sequel to the History of Colonel Edmond, in which the two sons of that personage will be represented as involved in the Revolutionary struggle, one a patriot and the other a loyalist. “Such a story,” observes the Messenger, “would possess a vivid interest for readers in the United States, while, from the abundant sources of information at the author’s command in the State Paper office and the British Museum, as to the social aspects of the Virginia Colony, we should have a right to look for a picture of the grand old days of our grandfathers, of rare fidelity and value.”
