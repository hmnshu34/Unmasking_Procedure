“The Weather”
THE WEATHER—Yesterday was hot. Fat women felt fussy, and fanned furiously. Lean women leaned languidly on lounges, or lolled lazily like lilies on a lake. Shabby, slipshod sisters sat silently and sadly sweating in the shade, while soiled and sozzling shirt-collars and sticky shirts stuck to such sapheads as stirred in the sun. Babies bawled lustily, and bit bobbins and bodkins till bedtime. Literary gentlemen who undertook a heavy task of alliteration, became exhausted in the middle of a weather paragraph, and gave it up for a cooler day.
