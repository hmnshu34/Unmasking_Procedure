“Conveniences to Reporters”
When the Mayor of New York sends a communication, long or short, to the Common Council, he has slips written out for the press; when the Mayor of Brooklyn sends one, the reporters are interrupted in their ordinary work of recording the detailed business of the Board by having to copy his Honor’s message for each paper. So in other departments, when a decision is made in the N.Y. Supreme Courts, it is forthwith posted up for the convenience of reporters and others; here they can only learn what has been or may be done by button holeing the Clerk of Records, and extorting information from him as dentists pull teeth. The reporters of the Brooklyn press have a hard road to travel in the exercise of their important and indispensable calling, as media through which information on public affairs is transmitted to the public. In no other civilized community are such difficulties thrown their way. There should be sufficient esprit des corps among our city journalists to ensure a united and emphatic call for reform.
