“The Expulsion of Alderman Preston”
	Though we fully recognise the propriety and justice of the course taken by the Common Council last evening in expelling Mr. Preston, we cannot help regretting, for the sake of his friends and connections even more than his own, that such an extreme step should have been rendered necessary by the circumstances of the case. Nor can we withhold a measure of pity for the expelled himself. There have been a great many instances of the offence which he committed, and rumor has so magnified their number, that the crime, serious as it is, has come to be regarded as a mere venial error.
	It is to be hoped that this example of strict and speedy justice will stay the hands of other men who have been in the practice of using their official position to enable them to fill their itching palms, either at the expense of the public or private citizens. The most veteran corruptionist may well pause, for a longer or shorter period, in his work of absorbing money that belongs not to him, on learning how utterly Mr. Preston has wrecked his present and clouded his future, by one unguarded grasp at the forbidden fruit. But the only true security for the uprightness of public officers, lies in promoting a correct moral tone among the public. As long as it is conceded—as a great many honest people do concede—that the eighth commandment is hardly applicable to office-holders, so long will even the punishment of detected offenders be insufficient to check the evil.
	By the way, the accused did not better his case by retaining Mr. Clinton. It must have cost him all the $250 he received from Mr. De Burg to pay the cost of a defence, whose only effect was to irritate the minds and tire the patience of the Board. In one legal axiom it is evident Mr. Clinton has a profound faith, viz., when you’ve a weak case abuse the plaintiff or his attorney.
