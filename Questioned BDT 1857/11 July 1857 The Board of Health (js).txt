“The Board of Health”
	From the report of the proceedings in the Board of Health yesterday afternoon, it seems as if the discovery of Messrs. Walsh and Preston’s interested leniency has driven the remainder of the Board into the other extreme; and that for fear of their honesty being suspected, they are going to be extra severe against all parties who may now be complained of. While it is better that a dozen manufactories should be shut up than that one life should be lost by pestilence, some regard should be paid by the Board to the fact that the presence of these establishments has a very beneficial effect on the trade and prosperity of the city. They employ a considerable number of laboring men, and are the means of drawing here a large amount of capital. It is clearly the interest of the community to foster and encourage them, and not condemn them to ruin or stoppage, unless it is very clearly proved that their existence is incompatible with the good health of the locality in which they exist. The action of the Common Council on the Atlantic street steam matter, proves that we have some men in our public bodies who would drive every vestige of commercial prosperity out of the city sooner than that their delicate nerves should be in the slightest degree affected, even by a little noise and smoke. We recommend to this class the advisability of laying down thick matting in the streets, to prevent those horrid carts from making such a clatter on the pavements.
