“Dead Milk Served Out By The Common Council”
We see that the Distillery people on Flushing avenue and Skillman street, are building up their cow-stables again—a vast group of botched and unsightly structures made of cheap hemlock boards—a disgusting nuisance of themselves, to say nothing of what comes from them. The Common Council, it seems, by a formal vote gave them permission! The milk of a thousand diseased cows, sent to twenty thousand human beings, a large proportion of them young infants, now goes forth every morning, endorsed by the City Fathers!
Will not Mayor Powell veto this act? We call upon him to do so. Not a poor old woman can keep a cow, pig, or goat, but it is liable at any moment to be wrested away by the police—and this happens frequently in the outer wards. Why then should these rich proprietors be so sweetly and deferentially treated? Some one spoke of their misfortune, through the fire. With this, the Common Council have nothing to do. It is every way incumbent upon the City to prohibit these dead-milk factories—not to resuscitate them with new life.
As the reader may be curious to see who say “yes” and who “no” to the serving out of the dead milk of the thousand cows, we reprint last Monday night’s vote in the Board of Aldermen:
For allowing the stables to be rebuilt, by altering the ordinance as proposed, 20, viz—Cashow, Russell, O’Neil, McNamee, Lowber, Doherty, Marrin, Clarke, Delvecchio, Hudson, Rowe, Spader, Bogart, Oliver, Shaw, Bannon, McMahon, Smith, Colahan, Palmer.
Against, 15, viz—Pierson, Dorlon, VanBrunt, Fithian, Walsh, Vail, Woglom, Wilson, Preston, Ralphs, Walter, Kalbfleisch, Suydam, Scholes, Jenkins.
