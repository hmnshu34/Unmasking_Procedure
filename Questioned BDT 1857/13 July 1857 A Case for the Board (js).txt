“A Case For The Board of Health”
	If one or two cases like the following were only pursued with inflexible determination by the Board of Health, the said Board would save themselves a great deal of trouble. Once settle it that such filth breeders and fever-spreaders must be stopped, how easy we would get along!
	There is a nuisance of long standing (and large spreading also,) in the grounds about forty rods southerly from the southwesterly corner of Myrtle and Classon avenues, in the 7th Ward. It consists of an old and filthy stable from which flow out the drainings of a number of dead-milk cows. This draining runs down and spreads itself out in flat pools and stagnant rotten ponds, some distance from the stable, and sends up continual streams of horrid incense, around the whole neighborhood. 
	The keeper of this place promised to abate the nuisance on two or three occasions last summer, but managed to evade it somehow. He has now constructed a trench and covered it over, to lead the drainage some rods away northwardly. This is the present condition of the stables. The current hot weather it is a most dangerous place. The filthy ponds alluded to are replenished every few days, and so keep up a continual exhalation.
