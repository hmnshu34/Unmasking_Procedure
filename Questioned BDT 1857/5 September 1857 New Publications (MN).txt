EMERSON’S UNITED STATES MAGAZINE—We have received the September number of this popular serial, and find it as full as usual of interesting and entertaining reading matter. The “Life of Washington” is continued. Then follows the poem called “Ruth,” illustrated with more than ordinary merit. An instructive paper on our colleges comes next. Major Downing continues his notes of “Thirty years out of the Senate.” “The British Empire in India,” and “Philosophy and Spiritualism” are the next two papers. Then comes a long and most interesting article on the life and works of that weird child of genius and misfortune—the authoress of Jane Eyre. We have not space to specify by name the remainder of the articles. Suffice it to say that all are of merit and some are most noteworthy. We can conscientiously commend “Emerson.”
COSMOPOLITAN ART JOURNAL – This splendid quarterly is deserving of the widest circulation. There is a catholicity and liberality about it which we like, and which ought to be imitated. It is most neatly executed in every respect, artistic and literary, and as an ornament to the parlor table stands almost unrivalled.
