“Savings Bank”
The run on the Savings Bank continued yesterday evening. On Thursday the amount drawn out was about $18,000, and last evening $15,000, but more accounts were closed yesterday than the day before, the deposits drawn out being smaller. A large proportion of the sums drawn out have already been returned by the owners, who find their money no safer in their own possession than in that of the bank. The withdrawal of these deposits, as it involves a forfeiture of the interest for the last six months, has been financially a gain to the Bank of 3 percent on all the sums withdrawn—or more than $1000. The Directors of the Savings Bank decline to say what is the exact amount of specie they have on hand, but they are satisfied that the depositors will get tired of drawing their funds out before they lose the ability to meet all demands for specie. Several ludicrous anecdotes are in circulation, illustrating the effects of the “panic” on the poorer depositors. Some after drawing their money would infer the solvency of the bank from the promptitude with which their demand was met, and on reaching the sidewalk would turn about, and after a moment’s thought retrace their steps to the counter to return the money they had received. One depositor, a worthy Teuton living in the upper part of the 16th ward, received $800 in gold in the earlier part of the week, and came back three days after with a haggard look and faded aspect, declaring that he had not slept a wink the past three nights, for fear somebody would steal “ter damn money,” which he begged the officers of the Bank to take back.
