“Third Senatorial District”
The Convention of the American and Republican parties in this district decided yesterday to present one and the same candidate for Senator before the people—to wit, Mr. John Winslow. It is generally believed that this fusion has very considerably narrowed Mr. Spinola’a chances of success, although the district is Democratic by 700 majority. As in the case of Mr. Booth, a large portion of the district were in favor of Mr. Tunis G. Bergen for Senator, and this portion will revenge themselves by either voting for the fusion candidate, or by not voting for that office at all. Leading Democrats do not hesitate to rejoice at this fusion. Of a truth Mr. Spinola has much to do to prevent a result which would seem to be inevitable.
The Eagle, as is well known, has made a terrible time over the rejection of Mr. Booth, while it has been dumb in the case of Mr. Bergen—although if the proprietor of that paper has a conscience it must have smitten him for his ingratitude. Mr. Bergen has always been faithful as faith itself to the Eagle—the needle not truer to the pole than he to it—yet where is the return? Although, as Mr. Van Anden well knows, the failure to nominate his friend gave great dissatisfaction to the old-fashioned Democracy, and although, as everybody knows, he entertained no liking for Mr. Spinola—yet notwithstanding all this the craven sheet breathed not a word perhaps be found in the fact that Mr. P.H. Booth has a goodly share of printing at his disposal, which he invariably gives to the Eagle, and which the proprietor of that sheet believed he would lose, if any one else were nominated—while in the case of Mr. Bergen, nothing but such, to him, mythical things as principle and gratitude were at stake. Mr. Spinola, if elected, might prove a troublesome foe,--Mr. Berger, defeated, will “forgive and forget.” Such were Van’s reflections. Oh, Van!
