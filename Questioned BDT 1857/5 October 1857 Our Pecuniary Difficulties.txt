“Our Pecuniary Difficulties”
The causes which have led to the present season of pecuniary embarrassment and difficulty are, that we have been studying, on the circumlocutory principle, “how not to do it.” Instead of devising methods for meeting our financial obligations as they have arisen, we have exhausted out ingenuity in endeavoring to evade payment; instead of seeking how to retrench and limit our expenditures, we have been inventing fresh modes of wasting our resources. Had half the ingenuity which has been devoted to evading and postponing the liquidation of our just obligations been directed to the best means of satisfying our creditors, the country would now have been out of debt. Had people been half as anxious to discontinue unnecessary expenses as they have been to discover and provide for fresh artificial wants, we should have lived within our income, and now have had a surplus in hand instead of a deficiency to make up. Instead of trying how far a limited expenditure would provide us with real comforts, we have been solving the problem of how large an income could be wasted in useless luxury and gaudy display. Instead of seeing how far within our income we could live, we have been trying to ascertain how far beyond it we could possibly venture. We must now return to first principles, and acknowledge, that he is wealthiest who saves most, and not he who makes most; and that the money we may have received is not our own until we have satisfied all just demands accruing upon it. If the financial crisis through which we are passing has the effect of instilling these ideas into the mind of the business community in general, we shall not regard the panic, with its dearly purchased experienced, as an unmixed misfortune.
