“Abolition Convention This Morning”
We dropped in this morning at the Abolition Convention, in the City Assembly Rooms, New York, and saw on the platform a line (shaped like a horse-shoe) of bald-headed Quaker-looking men, mostly wearing white neckcloths, generally surmounted by benevolent faces, and with limbs underneath cleanly dressed in thrifty broadcloth, of home-made fashion. To these a reverend personage was holding forth, with awkward gestures; the drift of his discourse seemed to be to prove that the founders of the Constitution “went in” for freedom—as if there could be any doubt about it. It was a very dry speech, and the room was about one quarter filled. 
We thought as we looked around the room of this convention this morning that a far greater power had taken the slavery question out of the hands of conventions and parties, and is now engaged, with perfect coolness and judgment, in considering it. Of course we mean the people. The people at large have been listening to the appeals of all sides, especially the abolition orators, and have perhaps come to the conclusion that while the ideas of abolition, and “uncompromising opposition to the further increase of slavery” are great ideas, there is no particular need of running them into the ground. We think the people will occupy some years in the weighing of slavery, and we think they will make a righteous decision upon it. We have no hesitation in saying that we consider the doom of slavery as sealed; it may spread toward the Gulf of Mexico; it may last awhile in the islands there—but it will certainly, before a hundred years have rolled on, become extinct in every one of the United States.
In the mean time, it should be remembered that the institution of slavery is not at all without its redeeming points, and also that there are just as great reforms needed in the Northern States. Perhaps there are greater reforms needed here than in the Southern States.
