“The City Railroad Company and Its Employees”
“Corporations,” it is said, “have no souls;” but they have a sufficient and pretty lucrative substitute, in the shape of a constant eye to their own interests. The Brooklyn City Railroad Company is an instance of this. Pleading “hard times” its millionaire directors have given notice of their intention to reduce, on and after Monday next, the daily pay of their employees from $1,50 to $1,25. The “hard times” is indeed the cause of this, but not in the sense intended. It is not that the company’s receipts are smaller, or less punctually paid, in consequence of the financial crisis; but the hard times have thrown so many men out of employment, that the company could fill the place of every man they have in half a day, in case of a strike. They know this, and regarding their employees as at their mercy, have revenged themselves on the men for their strike in April last.
The men say they work from 12 to 12 ½ hours every day, and from 14 to 16 hours on Sundays. The alleged pretext for the reduction of wages is that the traffic has decreased for the last few weeks; but this the men attribute to the heavy rains. The only real reduction in the traffic is that caused by some of the manufactories being closed, whose men formerly rode to and from work on the cars. The men acquit Superintendent Queen of having either advised or approved the reduction of their wages: they attribute the step to the same clique of Directors who opposed the running of cars on Sundays. There will not be a strike if this reduction is enforced; but the railroad employees say they hope that in the case the public will bear in mind the “hard times” as well as the directors, and insist on the reduction of the fares to the original standard of four cents.
