“Democratic County Convention”
The Democratic County Convention will assemble at Nelson’s, Flatbush, this afternoon. Upon it will fall the duty of nominating a candidate for Sheriff, also two Superintendents of the Poor, two Justices of the Sessions, two Coroners, and a School Commissioner for the County towns. The great struggle will be in regard to the Sheriff, which is beyond question the best office in the gift of the people of the County of Kings. With such a glittering prize in view, it is not surprising that a number of contestants have entered the lists, but ex-Ald. George Remsen, has the inside track and will distance all competitors. We would, in common with nine out of ten in this section, have been pleased could the honor have fallen on our fellow citizen, Robert W. Allen, but as this is not to be, we know of no better man than Mr. Remsen. The Superintendencies of the Poor are snug berths, and the nominations are not likely to go a begging. Mr. B.H. Booth, who was appointed to the vacancy created by the resignation of Judge Rushmore, and who has united with a majority of his associates in stopping several large leaks in the County charities, is a candidate. If the Convention care for the taxes, they will nominate Mr. Booth.
