“Harper’s Weekly”
HARPER’S WEEKLY is profuse with rare illustrations and instructive and entertaining reading matter. Each issue shows the falsity of the old cry, that we could not in America produce a pictorial and literary weekly. Many attempted it, and failed. The Harpers embraced success with their first number. They have made arrangements with Mr. Thackeray, at an expense of $2000, for advance sheets of his long-expected story “The Virginians.” The publication will be commenced in the Magazine for December, and will attract the attention of all classes of readers.
