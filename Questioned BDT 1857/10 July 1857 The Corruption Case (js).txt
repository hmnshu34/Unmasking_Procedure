“The Corruption Case Last Evening”
	We have not space to-day to comment as we would wish on the proceedings of the Common Council last evening in the Board of Health Corruption Case. In the absence of lengthened comment we can only refer our readers to the full report which we present of the proceedings.
	The patience with which the Board listened to the evidence, though much of it was irrelevant, and a great deal mere repetition; and the general interest evinced in the case, and the evident desire felt by the members at large to do justice in the case, will be some compensation to the public for the shock such disclosures cannot but give to their confidence in our public men. The propriety and good taste exhibited by Mr. Preston in employing an eminent criminal advocate, cannot be questioned; though it may fairly be doubted whether the success which has attended the diligent search of the counsel after new facts will tend to the exoneration of his client.
	Against one feature in the investigation, however, we must protest. Mr. Clinton throughout treats the committee as the prosecutors of the accused member, and speaks of them as “the other side,” assuming that the evidence they have collected is adverse testimony throughout. Instead of this, they are a commission of inquiry; and can only be opposed to the accused in so far as he is guilty. They have behaved with all leniency to the delinquents; have taken their own statements, as well as that of DeBurg; and have gone to an almost imprudent length of consideration, by omitting throughout to employ the Corporation Counsel, the legal prosecuting officer of the Board. Mr. Clinton is no more entitled to consider the committee as the prosecutors of his client, than he would be to call a justice of the peace a partisan, who, on sufficient evidence being taken before him, commits a prisoner to await the action of the Court of Sessions.
