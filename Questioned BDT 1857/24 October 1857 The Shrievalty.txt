“The Shrievality—Is Mr. [Burdett] Stryker Eligible?”
	This question being mooted by the Eagle the day before yesterday, and chapter and section of the law quoted to sustain its case, we did expect something like argument from the Star to rebut the idea. Instead of that we find in last evening’s Star a weak and spiteful paragraph, calling the Eagle’s movement “a mean trick,” but carefully abstaining from reference to the law cited by the Eagle.
	Now it is a matter of vast importance, not only that Mr. Stryker himself be satisfied of his eligibility, but that there be explained to the public the grounds of his assurance, so that they also may be convinced that they will not be throwing away their votes in bestowing them on him. While on the one hand a strong prima facie case is made out by the Eagle against the eligibility of Mr. Stryker, and on the other hand the Star rather will not or cannot rebut that case, it is foolish and absurd to expect to answer any enthusiasts on behalf of a candidate whose chance of election, even if he were to receive a majority of votes, would be left in doubt. It is due to Mr. Stryker, and to the voters of the county, that the grounds of the __ stated to have been given by Judge Pikeman and other should be made public.
	At the same time, we __ __ __ that the Eagle has exhibited its usual stupidity and fatuity in raising the question of Mr. Stryker’s disability now. Had the __ been reserved until the eve of the election, it would have been enough to have sunk any candidate beyond redemption. Now, by the premature discharge of the heaviest gun that could be brought to bear against them, Mr. Stryker’s friends have ample time either to withdraw him in favor of another candidate or to assure themselves and the public of the soundness of his position—in fact to adopt whatever course they may, so consultants think best to take.
