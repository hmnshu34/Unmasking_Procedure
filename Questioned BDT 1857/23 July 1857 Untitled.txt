There is a singular fact connected with Archbishop Hughes’s controversies. His attacks are very severe, and doubtless make the victim wince for the time being; but such is the anti-Roman Catholic feeling of the people at large that the reputation of being worsted by the prelate elevates a man into a position of notoriety and éclat. Erastus Brooks is the veriest quack who ever aspired to lead a national party; yet he has a considerable reputation, which it would be hard to trace to anything else than the figure he cut in “Brooksiana.” The Herald, also, owed no little of its rapid rise in public favor to its former contests with the most reverend duelist. Judging from these and other precedents, we should presume that Mr. Raymond will also acquire celebrity from his present bout with the archbishop.
