“The Fusion Accomplished”
The “fusion” of the American and Republican parties, so long derided and disbelieved in, even by many who were desirous of its accomplishment, has at last been brought about. Unanimously, without a single dissentient voice in either body, the Conventions of the two parties yesterday agreed on a joint County ticket, and with apparent earnestness and sincerity mutually pledged it their support. At the same time, each party vowed its continued and exclusive fidelity to its former obligations, as regards State and national politics.
It now only remains to be seen whether the same spirit of mutual respect and concession which actuated the County Conventions will be felt by the delegates who meet to-day and to-morrow in Senatorial Convention, and the day after to nominate Assemblymen. The leaders of both parties look to these meetings with intense anxiety, fearing that one or two imprudent, or overbearing, or selfish men may cause a dispute, the effect of which may extend to the whole city.
There was a goodly assemblage of Democrats among the outsiders at Flatbush yesterday, waiting, as they said, with more curiosity than apprehension to learn “whether this ill-assorted marriage would be consummated.” They expressed themselves as satisfied that there would be a very large defection of anti-fusionists from each party to the Democratic ticket; but judging from the material of the conventions, there is not a corporal’s guard of anti-fusionists in either party.
The success of this union movement will make the Democrats even more anxious, if possible, to strengthen the Remsen ticket by the addition of Mr. Booth’s name; and the strongest influences will be brought to bear on Mr. Powell to induce him to withdraw. If he does withdraw, Mr. Booth will be substituted; if not, Mr. Remsen will have a load to drag, and will fight Mr. Stryker at a disadvantage. Nous verrons.
