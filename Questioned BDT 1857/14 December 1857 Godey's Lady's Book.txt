“Godey’s Lady’s Book”
GODEY’S LADY’S BOOK, for January, abounds with matter, both pictorial and literary, interesting to the fair sex. It appears to be the ambition of Mr. Godey, not only to distance all other publishers of ladies’ magazines, but to surpass in each successive publication the attractions and merits of the previous; and by a strict adherence to this programme, he has rendered the Lady’s Book a periodical which no woman of fashion can afford to dispense with.
