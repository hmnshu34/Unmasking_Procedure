“[Mrs. Horace Mann on Food and Morals]”
Mrs. Horace Mann has written a volume to prove that rich and indegestible food generates bad morals. If this and its converse holds good, the Indian Sepoys who live on rice, and the Tipperary boys who feed on praties, ought to be meek and quiet, if not positively pious, personages. It would follow, also, that the true way to Christianise the outside barbarians of Borioboola Gha and other heathen localities, would be to feed them on pap and bread and cheese. If our diet regulates disposition, the inmates of our Penitentiaries, who live on mush and molasses, ought to be thoroughly reformed and made penitent by a few days incarceration. Horace Greeley would be the mildest mannered and most civil of men, from his vegetarian diet, if Mrs. Mann’s theory were correct.
