5 November 1857
“The Westminster Review”
We have received from the publishers, Leonard Scott & Co., No. 79 Fulton street, the current number of this most liberal of the English Quarterlies. For literary men and for readers of wide sympathies and cultivated tastes, this is now, and must continue to be, so long as it is maintained with an equal amount of ability, the exponent of the farthest advanced mind of the age. The present number opens with a light and sparkling article on “Female Dress in 1857,” in which the ladies receive what we can hardly help regarding as rather an unjust castigation on the score of their little frivolities and extravagance in the matter of costume. One might as well find fault with the tulips for budding as with the more expansive part of humanity for blossoming into “gorgeous array.” No woman can be expected to part with a constituent of her nature, though all masculine-dom were to set up newspapers to enforce the unreasonable demand. An article on “Political Priests” follows, and is succeeded by a review of a highly interesting book entitled “Quedah; or, Adventures in Malayan Waters.” Buckle’s “History of Civilisation in England,” furnishes the text for an elaborate paper. Mrs. Browning’s magnum opus, “Aurora Leigh,” is reviewed, at a somewhat late day, one would think. The writer recognizes the beauty, large-heartedness and bravery of the book but in common with most judicious reviewers bears hard on its artistic defects. Five other articles of various degrees of ability follow, and the reviews of cotemporary literature, which is the specialty of this serial, are able, and pungent as usual.
