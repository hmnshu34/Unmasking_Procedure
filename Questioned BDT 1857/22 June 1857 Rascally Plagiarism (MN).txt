“Rascally Plagiarism”
RASCALLY PLAGIARISM.—The public are enlightened as to how the New York Herald makes up its “own correspondence from all parts of the world.” The New York Times reproduces the 15th chapter of Emerson’s “English Traits,” side by side with a letter published in the Herald yesterday under a date London, June 5. The two are the same, sentence by sentence, with hardly the alteration of a word. The scamp who perpetrated the offense against literary honesty and propriety, would cheat his mother, or rob his children—if he has any, which Heaven forbid.
