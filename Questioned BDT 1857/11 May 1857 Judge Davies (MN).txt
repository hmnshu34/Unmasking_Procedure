“[Integrity of] Judge Davies”
For the admirable manner in which this distinguished jurist has borne himself in the Cunningham trial his praise is on every tongue. His close application to this case (by which time and money have been saved) has only been equalled by his impartiality and kindness of manner, and it is but truth to say that he has won a name which will stand conspicuous in the annals of jurisprudence. Johnson said that two lines of Shakespeare—
“I dare do all that may become a man
Who dares do more is none”—
Were sufficient, had he never written anything else, to have immortalized him. So of Judge Davies; if he never should take part in another trial, his conduct in this remarkable case would have been a sufficient distinction. This is not empty praise—it is but the homage which is justly due to distinguished public service, and what we all feel if we do not all express. And yet one of our cotemporaries, a poor, miserable cotemporary we admit, was either stupid or malicious enough to speak of Judge Davies after the following fashion:
Finally, we have Judge Davies, whose antecedents have, at least, shown him to be a good business man, and quite a lucky politician, but who, in presiding at this trial, manages to make himself as much a partisan and petty despot, in his judicial ermine, as Connery was in his fool’s cap.
