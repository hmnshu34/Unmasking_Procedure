“A True American”
The Albany Journal says:
“Robert J. Walker is not a man to be trusted. Supremely selfish, he is as ready to betray friends as to punish enemies—for a price. His professions to day are no guarantee of his actions to-morrow. Interest is his principle; and he is quite as ready to speculate in politics as in stocks.”
Such charges may answer for a political tirade, but they do not affect Walker’s merits as Governor of Kansas, --and we doubt whether the charges are true. Any how, if that man is cunning enough to see beneath the surface of party, and found his hopes on doing fair and square things, he fetches his cunning to a good market.
We are well pleased with R.J. Walker’s late speech at Topeka, and especially pleased at the manner of it. So much is in manner! The Territorial Governor was continually interrupted by his different hearers with true Western freedom, making all sorts of comments, and asking all sorts of questions. These came thick and heavy—but the Governor preserved his good nature, his nonchalance, and his intellectual readiness. There was something characteristic in the scene; it was one not to be witnessed out of America—probably not out of the West. That Walker carried himself so well, and came out with credit, proves him a true American in spirit. His manner is the proof, for, we repeat, that is always the proof. 
This is a great deal more than can be said of most of our public men. Who of them shows the like ease, the Democratic friendliness, the readiness, the capacity of being just as much at home among “border ruffians” as any where?
