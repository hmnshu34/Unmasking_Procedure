“The Partizan Press”
Under this heading the Star—heaven save the mark!—of yesterday takes occasion to get off some Pecksniffian comments relative to the “controversy going on between the Times and Eagle.” After reading the “I am holier than thou” sentiments of our cotemporary, we are led to question ourselves whether the Star was ever personal, and we are constrained to confess that we have read in that unpaid, non-political organ, some of the most “unscrupulous and vulgar tirades” ever penned. It will not do for the Star to start in business as a moral reformer, until it explains when its resolution “to turn over a new leaf” was made. Until this information is supplied we shall consider the Star an “evil soul producing holy witness,” “a goodly apple rotten at the core,” &c.
For the information of our “father confessor” we wish it distinctly to understand that the “unscrupulous and vulgar warfare” which has drawn it out was not inaugurated by us. We simply printed a paragraph illustrating the contempt which the Democracy exhibited for their organ in their nomination of a Superintendent of the Poor, when we were assailed with a shower of epithets worthy of a graduate of the Five Points, and if we retaliated in a strain which might be considered slightly “out of order”—for when it comes to throwing mud we knock under to the Agle, to adopt a Star phrase—it was but “human nature” after all. That’s so!
