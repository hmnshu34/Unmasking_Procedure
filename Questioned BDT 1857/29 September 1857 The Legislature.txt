“The Legislature and the Ferries”
If Mr. Beach succeeds in realizing his anticipations for a place in the Assembly, and in such an overwhelmingly Democratic district we hardly see how he can fail, we trust he will not confine his exertions to the Union Ferry Company. The Peck Slip Company are approaching the end of a lengthy and profitable chartered monopoly and will doubtless seek a renewal of their present privileges. The Houston street Company, some three or four years ago, obtained a ten years’ extension of a similar charter, from a notoriously venal New York Common Council, and we are afraid that the Peck Slip Company will be similarly favored at the public expense, unless some action be taken by the ensuing Legislature, which will place it out of the power of the Common Council of New York to effect another such arrangement. In fact we object in toto to the exclusive jurisdiction over the ferries, claimed by the New York authorities. We of Brooklyn are just as deeply interested in good management and cheap rates on the part of the ferry companies as the New Yorkers can be, and, in fact, more so; but we can never expect to have our reasonable wishes deferred to, as long as the Common Council of New York effects just such arrangements as it pleases with the ferry monopolists.
An act of the Legislature should be passed, applying not only to the Union Company, but to all the ferries on the East River, by which the interests of the public will be primarily consulted, instead of that of these influential and moneyed corporations. We shall look to Mr. Beach, if elected, for a comprehensive scheme of legislation on this subject.
