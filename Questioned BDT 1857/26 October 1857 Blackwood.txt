“Blackwood”
We have received from the publishers, Leonard Scott & Co., the October number of “Old Ebony.” It is full of interesting matter, as usual, but seems to have dropped politics for this month, and comes to us minus the usual elaborate, statesmanlike disquisition on current events. To the mass of readers, however, this will prove rather a recommendation than otherwise, when the space is filled up by such light and entertaining matter as Bulwer’s last novel and other pleasant reading. “New Sea-Side Studies,” are continued; “Modern Light Literature” displays a richly cultivated taste and a keen appreciation on the part of the writer; “Our Hagiography” is a learned dissertation on the Saints; and the remaining prose contents are sufficiently interesting. Blackwood publishes little verse, but that little is very sure to be good. A highly imaginative poem called “The Haunting Face” is contained in the present number. It will bear re-reading and meditation.
