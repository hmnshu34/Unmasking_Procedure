“The Colored Masons”
We are indebted to our colored fellow citizen, Dr. Ray, for a copy of a Philadelphia paper containing a lengthy description of the proceedings on the occasion of dedicating the new hall of the “Colored Masons” in that city. The procession appears representatives of Grand Lodges of various States, numerous subordinate Lodges, together with Royal Arch Chapters, Encampments of Knights Templars, and Grand Councils. The display is represented as having been showy and such to elicit universal admiration. There is no affiliation between the White and Black Free Masons in this country, which is attributable to the prejudices of cast rather than to anything inherently inimical in the institution itself. Indeed, Masonry expressly recognizes the human family as one of brotherhood, and embraces in its ubiquitous folds, men of all countries and religions. Hence the traditions of the Order, where brethren about to be tomahawked or shot down, or otherwise summarily disposed of by “barbarous force,” have given the magic signs, been recognized by ye savage and their mutton consequently saved.
