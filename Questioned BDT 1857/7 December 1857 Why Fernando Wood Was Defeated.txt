“Why Fernando Wood was Defeated”
Several theories have been broached to account for the defeat of the redoubtable Fernando, but we believe we are now in a position to specify the exact cause of his discomfiture. On the Sunday previous to the election, the Rev. W. R. Tompkins, of the South 9th street Congregational Church, descried among his congregation a ministerial friend from the country, and after the sermon had been delivered requested him to close the services by prayer. The country brother, in a broad, provincial accent, and with a voice pitched to an alto key, proceeded to supplicate various blessings for the congregation and the rest of mankind. Among other petitions he advanced something like the following:--“O, Lo—ord, thou knowest that there is an election about to take place, when all the gamblers, all the thieves, and all the bad characters of every sort, are on the side of one man. Therefore, O Lo—ord, we presume that the Devil is on that side too. And we beseech thee to make manifest they power in the defeat of this man, so that the Devil and all his followers who support him may be overthrown.” And most of the congregation said “Amen,” though there was a perceptible quavering, as if from suppressed merriment, in the responce. One of the editors of the Journal of Commerce was among the audience, and it is reported, hied him home in anything but a religious frame of mind. Who wonders at Tiemann’s election, after that.
