“[The Poem ‘Nothing to Wear’]”
The poem of “Nothing to Wear” has been published in the newspapers of the Sandwich Islands. The wide spread popularity of the clever but common-place effusion, shows how much more quickly the ephemeral and superficial in literature is appreciated by the public than that which bears the imprint of the highest genius. A hundred persons would read, understand and admire “Nothing to Wear,” to whom “Annabel Lee” or “The Ravens,” would be caviare.
