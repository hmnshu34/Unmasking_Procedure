“Harper’s Magazine”
	This favorite monthly has made its appearance for November. We learn from the publishers that the publication of neither the Monthly nor Weekly will be suspended or interfered with in any way by the financial panic and its distressing consequences. Both will proceed upon the even tenor of their way as heretofore.
	The present number of the “Monthly” contains the usual quantity of readable and entertaining matter. The illustrations are also of the first quality. The stories entitled “Lost,” “Helen Lee,” “Jacob Thorne” and “The man who was not an Egotist” are far superior to the ordinary run of Magazine tales. The Editorial Department is full of interest, as usual.
