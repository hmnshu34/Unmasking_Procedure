“An Excursion To Sands Point”
	Very few of the steady-going tradesmen of Brooklyn, absorbed in business cares and pursuits, are aware how many delightful pictures of rural beauty can be beheld within an easy distance of the city. Yesterday we were favored with an invitation to accompany the female department of Public School No. 17 with their friends, on an excursion to Sands Point, in the steamer John L. Lockwood. There were present Trustees Sparks and Lay, and Mr. Browne, of the Board of Education, together with a number of other gentlemen. Mr. Polly, to whose kindness the school was indebted for the excursion, was prevented from forming one of the party by being unwell. In his absence Mr. W. Parr, his business manager, acted the part of host with the urbanity and courtesy which are habitual to him.
	Sands Point is a really delightful locality—the view, the bathing, the richly wooded landscape—invite the searcher after recreation to visit it; and the Nostrand House, a spacious hotel, recently erected, affords every facility for the refreshment of the inner man. But the excursionists carried with them an ample store of refreshments, in consuming which, and in youthful sports, the children spent a day of unmingled pleasure. Miss Bodwell, the accomplished and unostentatious Preceptress, superintended the arrangements and did all in her power to promote the happiness of those under her charge. We understand that a similar treat will shortly be given to the male department of the school. The destination is well chosen; we consider Sand Points superior in its attractions as a place of resort to Shrewsbury and many other better known places.
