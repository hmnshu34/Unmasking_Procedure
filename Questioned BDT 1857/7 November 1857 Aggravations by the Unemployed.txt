“[Aggravations by the Unemployed]”
If the unemployed of New York, by loud-mouthed public meetings or riotous proceedings of any kind, expect to coerce the public into measures for their benefit through the fear of violence, they are very much mistaken. At their assemblages, as yet, comparatively few American born citizens were present. The greater portion was composed of communists, Red Republicans, rowdies, and demagogues in a small way, who seem attempting to initiate one of those movements which are common enough in European capitals in times of scarcity, but which it will hardly do to try on in these latitudes, just at present. These gentry are, as mobs and their leaders have been, in all ages, the real enemies of the poor, and we feel confident that the good sense of the great body of the unemployed will not be led astray by the contagion of their ill-example. We are likely to have hard enough times as it is, without any aggravations of the kind gotten up in the Park lately.
