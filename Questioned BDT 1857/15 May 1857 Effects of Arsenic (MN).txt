“Effects of Arsenic-Eating”
Travellers in Styria and other parts of Europe state that there exists among the inhabitants a practice of eating arsenic in small doses; that the people indulging in the drug believe it produces a blooming complexion, a brilliant eye, and appearance of embonpoint; that the dose, beginning with half a grain, maybe increased to several grains; and that symptoms of poisoning appear when the practice is given up. Medical writers whose attention has been drawn to the subject say, that the adult human subject will bear a small dose of arsenic—one-tenth of a grain per day, or less—without injury. After taking such dose for ten or twelve days the effects above mentioned are produced; but with the improvement in the complexion the doses should be omitted for about a fortnight, during which time the system will purge itself of the poison; a fresh succession of doses may then be taken for ten or twelve days more, and so on.
Such doses are said not only to improve the complexions of ladies, but to render horses more sleek and well looking; and they are also said to improve the wind of both men and horses. The latter, it is stated, will draw a heavier load up hill after a small dose than at another time. The great dangers of the use of so virulent a poison arise either from taking too large a dose at one time, or from neglect  to suspend the practice every alternate fortnight or so. With these limitations, it has been contended by eminent authorities that the use of the drug is rather beneficial than otherwise.
