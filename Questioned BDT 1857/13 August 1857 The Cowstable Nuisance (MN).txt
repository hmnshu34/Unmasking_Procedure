“The Cowstable Nuisance”
THE COWSTABLE NUISANCE—We have to-day a notice from the Board of Health, that they will meet at five to-morrow evening to hear evidence respecting the cow stables. Both the friends and the opponents of the cow stable and impure milk men are represented in the Board. Ald. Scholes, we trust, will be present to see fair play for the people, while Ald. Rowe, it is to be presumed, will take the same position he occupied in the Common Council in regard to the subject. We hope that those who reside in the vicinity of the stables, and who therefore are the most annoyed by the nuisance, will take the trouble to make out a complete case; if possible, they should procure an analysis of the milk, with evidence as to the quantity sold in this city, the prevalence of child diseases where it is consumed, and other particulars necessary to place the subject in the proper light.
But the cow stable matter in general is totally distinct from the particular case of Mr. Husted. The Board of Health may not deem the stables of others such a nuisance as to demand that they should be peremptorily forbidden; but there is a question of fact and law in regard to Mr. Husted’s stables, in addition. His stables were burned down, and rebuilt in defiance and contempt of the city ordinances; and even if the Board are unwilling to adopt the extreme measure of forbidding the rest, they may find it their imperative duty, in executing the ordinances of the city, to deal differently with Mr. Husted, whose case must be considered on its own merits, apart from the general subject.
