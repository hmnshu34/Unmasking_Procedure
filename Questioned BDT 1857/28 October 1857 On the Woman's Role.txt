“[On the Woman’s Role]”
The last number of Harper’s Magazine contains a just protest against the common cant of the day with regard to women. Among other points, the writer touches upon the disposition manifested to regard the fairer part of creation as merely calculated for household drudges, and to estimate their merits simply by their qualifications as housekeepers. Undoubtedly, this state of feeling exists among a large class of the sterner sex. They seem to imagine that woman was made for no nobler and loftier purpose than to fulfill the ordinary claims of domestic life. Their mouths are full of “wise saws and modern instances” concerning the cooking of dinners and the darning of stockings. Intellectual culture, according to them, should be separated from all connection with femininity. A woman who is capable of thinking of something besides buttons and baking-pans is voted a “blue,” and regarded with horror. We hope that some of this class may chance to read and “inwardly digest” the timely article in “Harper.”
