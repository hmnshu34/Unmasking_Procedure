“The Election In The 15th Ward”
The exciting contest in the 15th Ward has been brought to a close, and Daniel Maujer, Esq., the Republican candidate, has been elected Alderman of the ward by a plurality of twenty-seven votes. The following is the result.

With one exception everything passed off in quiet. Little rum was imbibed, thanks to the wise regulations concerning the hotels and porter-houses, and there was no disorder to speak of.
All the parties were sanguine of success, but, from the first, it was tolerably apparent that the contest really lay between Maujer and Thursby. As it is, the result has surprised few, and, we think, has given a very general satisfaction. The alderman elect is a man of undoubted integrity and ability, and has had sufficient official experience to qualify him for performing the duties of the position understandingly and efficiently. He has been tried and not found wanting. We are satisfied that in his hands the interests of the ward will be safe.
Towards the latter part of the day many of the Marshal men, becoming convinced that there was little prospect of the election of their candidate, joined the Republican ranks for the nonce and cast their votes for Maujer. This move may open the way for a prospective union between the two parties in this ward. 
The defeated candidates bear their disappointment very philosophically. Eames, especially, was calm, complacent, and smiling. He says he is the best satisfied man in the ward. The friends of the parties, however, who worked for their favorites like beavers, yesterday, seem to take their respective disappointments rather more to heart.
Last evening, the various saloons and public houses of the ward were filled with politicians and miscellaneous parties, engaged in discussing the result. As a general thing, the election of Mr. Maujer seems to give wide-spread satisfaction.
The exception to the general good order of the day, referred to above, was a personal collision between two of our leading Democrats. The affair originated in a trifling dispute and did not amount to much, though it caused a good deal of talk in the bar-rooms and elsewhere.
The only candidate who voted at the election is understood to be Mr. Eames.
A moral might be elicited from the contest, without the exercise of much ingenuity. It is so obvious, indeed, that we leave the reader to draw his own conclusions, and defer to a future opportunity any lengthened editorial comment.
