LITERARY INTELLIGENCE.—It is reported that T.B. Aldrich, author of “Babie Bell,” a plagiarism from Gerald Massey’s “Ballad of Babe Christabel,” is engaged upon another infantine effusion, to be called “The Blessed Bogus Baby,” and founded upon recent well-known events. Probably Harper’s Weekly will secure the prize. Readers of the puling, Tennyson—and water, school will doubtless take notice.
