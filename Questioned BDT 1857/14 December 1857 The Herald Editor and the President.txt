“The Herald Editor and the President”
The Washington correspondent of the New Orleans Picayune states that Mr. Buchanan, fearful of being subjected to a like merciless stream of abuse to that which the New York Herald poured upon the luckless head of “Poor Pierce,” has concluded an offensive and defensive treaty of alliance with the Satanic editor; that in pursuance of the terms therefore one of Bennett’s attaches has been appointed consul at Bordeaux. Bennett junior is to be appointed to West Point, and the old man himself is to realize the long sought object of his ambition, in getting a foreign mission. Among other evidences of the truth of these statements, the writer mentions that when at the capital a few days ago, Bennett dined, by special invitation, at the White House, Secretary Cobb being the only other guest present.
