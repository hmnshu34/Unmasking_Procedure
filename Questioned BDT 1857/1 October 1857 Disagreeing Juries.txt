“Disagreeing Juries”
Excessive litigation has caused the sessions of our courts to be continuous and almost uninterrupted; their numbers have multiplied and their sessions have been prolonged, until what with the large number of people who are exempt from service on various accounts, there are really not enough competent jurors to meet the demands of the courts.
This state of things has given rise to the employment of professional jurors—talesmen—fellows who make a living by being jurors, and thus not unnaturally come to look upon the whole machinery of justice as having been created for their benefit, so as to afford them a livelihood. Entertaining this view, they soon become unscrupulous as to the morality of their actions, and unmindful of the solemnity of the oath which is so often administered to them.
Where talesmen are on the panel of jurors, a pretty accurate guess can always be given as to the result of a case, irrespective of the evidence, after the complexion of the jury is once known. If the jury is composed entirely of honest men, non-professional jurors, the decision will be accordance with the law and the facts; if talesmen have the exclusive occupation of the place allotted to the jury, the prisoner’s fate will depend on his bleeding freely; and if the jury consist partly of honest men and partly of talesmen, they will of necessity be “unable to agree.” Thus it was in the case of Baker, for killing Poole; thus it has been in the cases of malfeasance on the part of officials both here and in New York, and thus it is now with Cangemi.
There is one, and but one remedy, for these mockeries of justice—these farces, which neither free an unjustly accused man from suspicion, nor punish a guilty man according to his deserts. That remedy is to adopt a similar practice to that which prevails in Scotland, so that the verdict shall depend on the finding of a majority or two-thirds of a jury, instead of requiring it to be unanimous, and thus putting it in the power of some stupid, headstrong, or venal man, to nullify the decision of the remaining eleven, and defeat the ends of justice.
