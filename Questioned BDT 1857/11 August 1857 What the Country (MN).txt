“What The Country People Think”
It is evident from Mayor Wood’s circular to the country postmasters, and other circumstances, that he and his friends hope to obtain the sympathy of the country districts at the next election, and a favorable verdict from the voters at the polls, in regard to the troubles which they have fomented in the metropolis. We very much doubt, however, if the verdict of the country people will not be the other way. Rural populations are always law-abiding; and the country-voters in general, which shocked at the state of anarchy into which the city has been plunged, will be likely to attribute it, not to the faults of the laws passed by the late Legislature, but to the refusal of the Mayor to render obedience to them. The editor of the Evening Mirror, who has been on a tour through the State, intimates that the country people “believe that New York, by a combination of discharged policemen, official plunderers and private felons, would be sacked in a week’s time if it were not for the Seventh Regiment! The opinion is openly expressed by the most reflecting, grave and sensible public men of the interior, and the New Yorker who is now anywhere there on his travels, can not fail to hear it expressed in every circle he may enter.” Previous to the passage of the Metropolitan Police Act and other laws of the last Legislature, the country people held the same sort of opinion, though not in so decided a form, of their city neighbors; and it was to their profound horror at the extent to which, under the auspices of Fernando Wood, the city was being plundered and misgoverned, that the passage of these laws is to be attributed. Certainly, as it has turned out, these laws have proved anything but efficacious for the purposes they were meant to fulfill; but they have not yet had a fair trial, owing partly to the desperate and unlooked for rebellion against them of Mayor Wood and his friends, and partly to the imbecility of some of those who were entrusted with the duty of carrying them into execution. We can see no ground for the belief that the country districts will recede at the next election from the stand they have taken; on the contrary we are inclined to think that the temporary obstacles which have been strewn in the way of the peaceable execution of these laws, and the still worse aspect which affairs in New York have assumed, will only tend the more to convince the country people of the necessity of a radical change in the administration of the city affairs.
