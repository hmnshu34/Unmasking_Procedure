“Juvenile Burglars”
Five Boys—small, young, and insignificant—felt themselves in want of pocket money some two weeks ago, and resolved on a straightforward but dishonest way of obtaining supplies. Within the next eleven days and nights, they had burglariously broken into the following stores, (and how many others we know not):
Grocery store corner Second and North Third.
Feed store corner North 4h and Second.
Grocery store corner North 1st and Fourth.
Grocery Store South 3d and Second.
Grocery store North 3d and First.
Sawyer’s shop corner North 5th and Second, (twice).
Blacksmith’s shop corner North 8th and First.
Grocery store corner South 4th and Fourth.
Grocery store South 7th and Third.
One of the boys, named Wilson, when he found all was up, tried to sneak out of the scrape by betraying the rest; but as he is a hardened little villain, who has been concerned in similar affairs before, the officers preferred to admit Liston as State’s evidence. This morning Liston accompanied officer Murphy round to the scenes of his various robberies, and informed him of the modus operandi resorted to in each instance, the amount of plunder netted, &c.
It seems the boys rarely stole anything but money and cigars, knowing that these could not readily be identified. 
In the last-named attempt they were frustrated by the appearance of a private watchman on the scene, who however had not the sense to arrest them. But acting on information given by him, some of the police gave chase and captured one of the boys. Next day officers Murphy and Jacobs captured two others; last Monday officer Taggart arrested another, and on Saturday, office Lee completed the business by taking into custody the fifth.
