“Constable’s Bills”
Great complaint is made of the enormous bills now being made out by constables in our police courts. The taxpayers, if aware of the facts, would be astounded at the enormity of these Bills. Constables make out “Co.” Bills—that is they do the business in Companies, make out and swear to their bills in Co., get the Justices to certify in company, and then get the money on them.
We mention as a sample one bill presented on the 7th inst., to Judge Culver for taxation. It was a bill of $143.76 for twenty-six days services, made out by one constable and “Co.”—sworn to by the two, certified by three Police Justices; that is each Justice certifying the whole bill, and that he issued the process.
The law knows no such partnership operations. It requires each constable to make out and swear to his own bill, and to procure the certificate of the particular Magistrate who issued the process in that particular case, to certify to its truth, and then to be taxed by the City Judge. 
We learn that these partnership bills and joint certificates have been carried on to a great extent. 
In the bill referred to, some ten or twelve of the complaints were by one of the constables presenting the bill. One constable complaining, another constable serves the warrant, and the two make out and swear to a company bill.
Judge Culver refused to tax the bill, and ordered it returned.
