“Unsettled Long Island Lands”
While there is so much talk about colonizing by emigration from the Northern States the unsettled lands of Virginia, Georgia, and other distant places, how is it that no one thinks of settling the thousands and tens of thousands of acres of wild Long Island lands? Two-thirds of Suffolk County lie to-day unploughed and unfruitful—most of it in open commons. The peninsula of Montauk contains some of the best soil in the State, all open and unused, except for grazing horses and sheep. It alone is capable of supporting in comfort a population of a hundred thousand—while the whole population of Suffolk county is not over forty thousand. All around Peconic bay, and westward to Riverhead, and from that place on to the town of Huntington, and including that town, there is a great deal of good land—with a great deal of poor land also.
In these remarks we do not wish to endorse any of the “village-lot” speculations, but would rather caution our readers against them—some of them are the greatest of swindles. To settle for permanent cultivation, on a tract of land, work one’s way by hard labor, suffering many discouragements and disappointments, and waiting more than one year or two years for competent returns—that is what the poor emigrant far West or South would have to undergo; and that is what the same sort of enterprise would have to undergo on Long Island.
With all these things, we believe the advantages to farm-settlers are very great on the eastern-third of our island. The facilities for fishing, and other advantages of the bay and sea-shore, with the nearness to the city market, are enough to counterbalance any disadvantages that can be named.
