	Election is over, and glad are all the ladies. The papers contain something besides politics. Husband keeps passably regular hours, and doesn’t get a little “how come you so” any more. Husband doesn’t make love to all the scoundrels he meets. Husband doesn’t shout for Morgan, or Parker, or Burrows, in his sleep every night. Husband doesn’t forget to order up something for dinner. Husband looks at the children and renews acquaintance with them. Husband is slowly recovering from that cold he caught while electioneering with his coat off. Husband treats wife as if he thought her the little dear thing she really is, which fact he forgot some time before election. Husband, in fact, is “real good,” and he “couldn’t be any better if he should try—so there!”

	The Williamsburg Harmonic Society have adopted a wise policy in furnishing for the public a first class entertainment at a low rate, the inevitable result of which will be success. The Concerts of this Society last season are held in remembrance by all who attended them, as being superior to, and more successful than any others ever given in this city, and we anticipate, from the programme, that the Concert announced for Wednesday evening next, will exceed in brilliancy and previous efforts of the Society. A new and much needed feature has been added, vis, a large and efficient orchestra, which will prove an additional attraction and give greater variety and effect to the entertainment.
