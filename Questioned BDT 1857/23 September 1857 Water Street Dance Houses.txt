“Water Street Dance Houses”
Yesterday we published the particulars of a fatal row, in which a man was shot down and killed in Water street, New York. Morrissey, the homicide, has been committed to prison to await examination. The whole affair occurred as our readers will have perceived, at one of those infamous dens which have made the name of Water street disgraceful.
What are the police about? Why are these hideous excrescences suffered to exist and parade their infamy so unblushingly? A little while ago, a perfectly quiet place in 11th st. was broken open and it habitués exposed. But here in Water street every house is devoted to prostitution and bad rum—every one is disorderly, every one is reeking with disease and debauchery—but still no measures are taken to abate these abominable  nuisances.
