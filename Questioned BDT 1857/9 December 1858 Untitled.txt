“Untitled”
In Dr. Sanger’s recent valuable work on prostitution, it is stated that the author applied, on the part of the Ten Governors, to the authorities of all the leading cities in the Union, for statistics of the great vice of the age—the vice most general, most costly, and most ruinous to health and morals, of all vices. Several of the mayors of cities replied, and their statistics, in connexion with those of Dr. Sanger relative to New York, while they cannot possibly minister to prurient curiosity, enable the philanthropist and social reformer to gauge, in a measure, the vast depths of that horrid abyss of depravity and disease—all the more awful because the pseudo modesty of this hypocritical age shrouds it with darkness, and refuses to look at it. Among those cities that made no response to Dr. Sanger’s inquiries, was Brooklyn. Why was this? Has the City of Churches so dark a side to its fashionably religious exterior that the Mayor and Police Superintendent dared not draw back the curtain and expose the hideous sight to the public gaze? 
We have no morbid love for looking on the horrible, but, as the physician cannot prescribe for a disease which he sees not the symptoms and extent of, so neither can there be any reformatory movement made in this city, while the extent of the damning plague spot is scandalously concealed from view by our public authorities.
