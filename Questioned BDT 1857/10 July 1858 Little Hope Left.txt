“Little Hope Left!”
We expressed, at the time of the sailing of the Telegraphic Fleet, our very slight hopes that the gigantic enterprise would be successfully accomplished. The difficulties which surrounded the project from its inception, and which were too formidable to be entirely explained away by any process of scientific reasoning on the part of hopeful savans—the doubtful results of the trial trip—the unpropitious weather, which the fleet had to encounter, and which has been totally unlike what we had hoped and expected in the month of June—and the non-arrival of the Niagara at her point of destination, all lead us to believe that another failure will be the result of this wonderful undertaking.
Must it be so? Must two continents give up this grand hope of eternal union, the fruition of which was to accomplish such vast things for humanity—which was to be a peace-maker and a world’s benefactor—which was to enlarge the circle of knowledge by annihilating time and space until man should have become, indeed, but little lower than the angels?
Well, if it is not to be, we have, at all events, made the attempt. We attempt things on a Titanic scale, and if we do not succeed the first time, we “try again.” Anything not absolutely, by the invincible laws of Nature impracticable, we are bound to accomplish. So if the present attempt and future essays which may be made in our day and generation should prove unsuccessful, our children or our children’s children may yet see the great problems solved and rejoice in the benefits it will confer.
