“Religion”
Religion, like conscience, is a thing of very ductile and elastic nature. It varies like the weather; it shapes itself according to the geographical position of the locality. What is orthodoxy here, is heresy of the worst kind somewhere else. The sentiments whose utterances would procure you an ovation here, would condemn you to a coat of tar and feathers there. Here, you are not sound in the faith if you do not believe that slaveholding is the unpardonable sin; there, you are read out of the church if you do not confess it to be the sum of all Christian virtues. Yet none but bigots or fanatics doubt that good and honest men abound among both slaveholders and “abolitionists.” It is stated that the Alabama Conference of the M.E. Church has unanimously voted in favor of expunging from the discipline the general rule forbidding “buying and selling of men, women, and children, with an intention to enslave them.”
