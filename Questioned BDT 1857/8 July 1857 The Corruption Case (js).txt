“The Corruption Case”
	  It is understood that the two Aldermen whose trial for bribery is fixed for to-morrow evening before their colleagues of the Common Council, are playing a deep game to avert the consequences which they anticipate from an inquiry by the Board. First in their programme stands an effort to prevent a quorum being formed to-morrow evening. Well, there maybe be no quorum, but the public will have little difficulty in getting at “the reason why,” and in exacting a strict account of the absentees.
	Many people have wondered why these men have not resigned—and if the public once learn that they are resolved to “brave it out,” and to endeavor by postponements and “dodges” to avert the investigation of their colleagues into the facts, we shall be surprised if measures are not taken to bring the case before a tribunal whose proceedings admit of no lobbying, and whose finding carries consequences in its train far more serious than those which the Common Council can inflict on recreant members.
	If this inquiry is to be hushed up and stifled, no future charge against the honesty and probity of our public men can be too serious to be credited. We recommend those of the Board of Aldermen, therefore, who value their reputation in the least, to evidence their own honesty by a strict investigation into that of the accused members.
	Nor is this all. If the implicated parties are accessible to our advice, we should decidedly recommend them not to avoid meeting their accusers on this issue. For if by staving off the trial a week or two they hope the whole thing will subside, they are woefully mistaken. And every day’s delay after to-morrow night will bring with it additional chains in a link of evidence connected with past transactions, the disclosure of which will distill an odor, compared with which that of Mr. De Burg’s manure will be found positively fragrant.
