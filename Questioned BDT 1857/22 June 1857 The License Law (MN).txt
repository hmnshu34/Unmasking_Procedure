“The License Law”
Liquor dealers both here and in New York seem to have renounced the hope of upsetting the new license law. In this county 201 licenses have been granted, 99 of which have been paid for. Latterly there appears to have been a general panic among those dealers who were at first most disposed to hold out, and applications for licenses have been pouring in upon the Commissioners. The same thing, we see by the Herald, is taking place in New York. Our Excise Board have nearly terminated their sittings, yet they have some 150 applications before them unadjudicated upon. Probably many of the houses for which licenses have been applied for are not required, and will fail to obtain licenses; but if their claims are ever so well founded, they have only themselves to thank for their obstinacy in holding out until too late. The entire closing on Sunday, though the most objectionable feature of the law, appears to be gaining ground. Those who have obtained licenses did not open yesterday, and those who sold at all did so “on the sly.” A thorough enforcement of the Sunday clause would require the whole of the Metropolitan police, in the 16th ward. The houses along the various roads in the suburbs, most frequented by Sunday travelers, keep open, supplying strangers, but refusing liquor to residents. We cannot find any section in the Act which warrants them in drawing this distinction.
