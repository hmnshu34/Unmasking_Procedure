“The Truant Home”
	The Eagle in reply to our remarks on its attack on the Truant Law, states that we have given much abuse of it, but no argument against it views. This is a misstatement, which we can __ to let pass. The objections __ __ __ law is that a parent has the right to do as he pleases with his child, and that to compel him to send it to school, or educate and take care of it at home, is a piece of despotism more tyrannic than that of Austria. Now if it were proposed, or the law sanctioned, the wholesale kidnapping of children found alone in the streets, and the hurrying them off to Flatbush, as the Eagle seems to think, there would be room for objection to the details of the law, good as its intentions might be. But this is not the case; there is to be a careful inquiry, first by the Truant Officer and then by the Justice, into the facts of each particular case. And only on its being “satisfactorily established” that the child is “idle and truant,” can be dealt with under the Act. And even then the parent will have the option of taking care of the child himself, instead of being absolutely required to part with it. We see no great “despotism” in this; nor do we believe that the State would be doing its duty, either to the children or the community, if it did less to rescue them from liability to a career of vice and crime.
