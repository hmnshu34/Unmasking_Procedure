“A Mote and a Beam”
Our Board of Health appear to be gifted with very peculiar faculties. They can behold death and destruction, contagion and cholera, and a thousand other evils threatened to the city from the existence of a sunken lot away at Bushwick or somewhere else beyond the line of population, but a great, reeking, stinking canal, extending right up into the centre of the city, escapes their observation. The Wallabout Creek—the receptacle of all the sewage, distillery swill and other abominations of the central part of the city, emits a stench more powerful and more deadly than the concentrated odor of all the stagnant water in all the sunken lots to be found between Gowanus and Newtown Creek. Yet the Board order the lots to be filled up, while they are content to leave the inhabitants to stop their noses as they pass the creek. You may ride by all the manufacturing establishments from Hunter’s Point to the Wallabout, and nowhere will your senses be offended with such an obnoxious odor as is emitted from the creek or canal near the corner of Hewes street and Kent avenue. The smell is not unlike that of sulphurretted hydrogen, and its chemical influence on the atmosphere is strong enough to tarnish all the metal door knobs in the vicinity! One of the members of the Board of Health professes to be especially desirous of having the 19th ward free from infection, (and many substantial reasons he doubtless has for his course in this respect) but we assure him that the value of real estate in that ward is depreciated incomparably more by the existence of Wallabout Creek in its present state of reeking nuisance, than it would be by having a bone boiling establishment located on every other block.
