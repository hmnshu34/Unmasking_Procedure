“Literary Gossip”
LITERARY GOSSIP.—A new work by Mr. J. Parton, entitled “The Life and Times of Aaron Burr,” will be published about the middle of October. A leading object of the work is to narrate the rise of the Democratic Party in this country, and to show the means by which its first victory was won. 
The Fourth Volume of the “Abridgement of the Debates in Congress,” by Col. Benton, is ready for publication, and will shortly be issued. The most important feature in the volume is the record of the speeches of Calhoun, Clay, Crawford, John Randolph and other cotemporary statesmen in the early stages of their political career.
