“We Progress!”
Charles Dickens, some years ago, gave a picture of American life and manners, in “Martin Chuzzlewit,” which was not greatly relished by readers on this side of the Atlantic. They insisted that his portraitures of such people as Chollop, with their bowties and revolvers, were libelious, and that nothing answering to them could be found in nature, unless it were on the extreme limit of Western civilization. But just look at the journals of the day, and say whether they were or not. Mobs and murderers appear to rule the hour. Everybody who feels himself aggrieved, takes the law into his own hands and appeals to the revolver. The revolver rules, the revolver is triumphant. Juries discharge, without leaving their seats, the gallant and lion-hearted fellows who fire revolvers at unarmed men, and avenge their wrongs without the bore and expense of a criminal trial. Other equally gallant fellows, seeing them go unwhipped of justice, do not scruple at gratifying their little private animosities in a similar manner. No punishment follows crime. It is a moral impossibility to hang a bloody miscreant now-a-days, and it is altogether a very beautiful, comfortable and safe state of society that we are falling into. Reader, have you an enemy? Is he a chivalrous, gallant fellow? Go home and make your will.
