“’Moral Insanity’ at the Flushing Lunatic Asylum”
The public scrutiny has been directed very specifically, of late, to this mysterious institution, where, it appears, husbands may imprison their wives, and guardians their wards. The case of “Carrie Woodman” first awakened attention to it, but further developments are likely to come to light in connection with it. An interesting affair has been brought on the tapis by the issue on Saturday, by Judge Davies, of a writ of habeas corpus in the case of Anne Bassett Smith, a young lady, who, it is alleged, has been for the past seven years an inmate of Sanford Hall, this private mad house, which has recently been brought to the notice of the public. Moral insanity is the pretext assigned for keeping the lady in question in duress for so long a period. Another interesting case may be looked for.
