“The Slave Trade [Cuba, a Black Republic]”
The slave trade, doubtlessly flourishes and is carried on vigorously, but not as vigorously as some of the newspapers give out—one of which asserts that the ebony isle Cuba numbers upwards of three hundred craft. This is simply preposterous.  The planters of Cuba could never muster the cash to pay for a tithe of the negroes which such a fleet would be constantly disembarking; besides the price of human flesh would not rule so high if the supply were so large. Again, three hundred vessels would soon depopulate the coast of Africa, which is not over populous, if we could for a moment believe that number to be engaged in the horrible traffic. The slave trade would soon be suppressed if the Governments—chief among whom is Britain—which maintains cruisers on the coast of Africa, were not “making believe.” Spain dare not conceive of the landing of slaves on the island of Cuba, were an energetic remonstrance made to her.  Cuba, however, produces certain crops which are indispensable to the civilized world, and as the supply of these necessities is only limited by the amount of labor, her planters are allowed to go on and add to their slave population. It is not difficult to prognosticate under all this will result in. Cuba will in time be so stocked with blacks that a confidence in their own strength and numbers will suggest an insurrection, as in St. Domingo. Their independence once achieved, it would be impossible for Spain to reduce the aroused and infuriated blacks again to slavery. Napoleon, with a fleet and 80,000 men, tried the game with the Haytiens and failed.
	What a beautiful prospect is here presented for our Southern planters.  A black republic almost within sight of their shores.
