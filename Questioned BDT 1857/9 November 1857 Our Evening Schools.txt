“Our Evening Schools”
These great institutions are flourishing like a green bay tree. The attendance is much larger this year than it was last, showing an increased appreciation on the part of the youth of both sexes for whose benefit they are designed. For example, in the Fifth ad North Fifth street school, (Mr. Woodworth’s) the highest number in attendance has been 234 and the lowest 144—average 193-100 better than last year. The female department in this school embraces 105 pupils who pursue their studies with much diligence under the able supervision of Miss Hart. We have not been able to visit the 15th Ward school, but in a conversation with Mr. Bush, its accomplished Principal, we learned that the attendance was enormous—being double that of the 14th ward. Mr. Bush has a class of ninety grown-up Germans, who are successfully striving to master the rudiments of the English language, and this fit themselves for citizenship. Mr. Bush says the demeanor of these men is in the highest sense commendable, and the zeal which they exhibit in the pursuit of their studies above all praise.
The amount of good which these evening schools are doing in providing the means of education to a class of people who must otherwise have remained in ignorance cannot be estimated in dollars and cents. Let every young man, with whom ignorance is not bliss, hasten to attend. It is suicidal for him to delay.
