“New Publications”
We have received Harper’s Magazine for October. It is a capital number and full of interesting articles and illustrations. The paper entitled “the ship of the desert” gives with its accompanying cuts, a full description of the Camel; “A Winter at the South” abounds in picturesque word-painting; and the tales of “The Bronze Gaiters,” “The Pride of Moses Grant” and “The Fair Dona Bella” are equal to anything of the kind we have ever read.
The “Weekly” of the same publishers has also been received. It is fully up to the mark.
“Viola” is one of the series of Harper’s Story Books. It is well-calculated to please and instruct children.
We have received from the publishers, Leonard Scott and Co., the North British Review for August. Under the new regime, we find the “North British” as orthodox as it was in the beginning and before Kingsley and his composers made it the organ of the new philosophy. It had articles on Bacon; Watts; French treatment of criminals; Interior China; Scottish Lunacy Commission; English Metrical Critics; The Marriage and Divorce Bill; Early Christian Songs; Inspiration; The Indian Crisis. The Quarterly is eminently worthy of the attention of intelligent readers.
