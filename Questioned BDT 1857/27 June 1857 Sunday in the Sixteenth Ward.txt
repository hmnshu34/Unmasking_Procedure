27 June 1857
Sunday in the Sixteenth Ward”
	Taking a walk upward from the more staid and demure 13th, you soon arrive at the boundary line of the 16th Ward—9th street—but Dutchtown does not comprise the whole of the 16th Ward, and you pursue your way some four or five blocks further before you arrive at the “real genuine original” Dutchtown. Once there, you cannot mistake the place—the innumerable lager bier shops, the promenading groups, the harmonious strains issuing from latticed gardens and curtained halls, the “sweet German accent”—all bear witness to the locality. Dutchtown is in its zenith from noon till dark. Our present stringent license law has no apparent effect on Dutchtown: there you encounter no difficulty in getting whatever you wish for to assuage your thirst—barring a soda-cocktail, the art of manufacturing which mysterious compound has not yet been mastered by any lager-bier saloon keeper we have met with; in fact, at the last place patronized, the waiter, or rather waitress, a young lady of 18, dressed in blue frock, white “josey,” brown gaiters, cameo ear-drops, and a “bully” gold brooch, not wishing the place to appear deficient in anything, informed us that “we has blenty sozawasser, but de cocktail he’s all solt.”
	Standing at one point, we perceived 7 churches, 1 school house, 1 engine house, 1 bucket house, and 2 bier gardens, all within hailing distance of each other. The Germans are a rational, social and happy people; and no matter how crowded one of their bier gardens may be, every one attends to his own affairs.
