“Our Daughters”
Educate them at home. It is wrong, as the records will show, to expose these impressible intellects –to the miscellaneous associations of one of those caravanseras, denominated boarding schools. What is learned there is superficial in the extreme, at the best, and never can compensate for the lack of genuine home culture, with its conservative influences.
Educate them at home. In that way they will keep clear of many temptations.
No one who has been exposed to the influences of these places can doubt, for a moment, that their effects are injurious. No one who has been an inmate of one of them can hesitate, for a moment, in considering them as superficial in the extreme and injurious in their effects on the impressible mind of youth. No real good is evolved, little is learned which makes a permanent impression on the mind, and time and money is little better than wasted.
All the elements which go to make up the home-life are sadly lacking in the education of our young girls. A little superficial and artificial book-learning, and all is done. A thousand girl influences are brought to bear upon them, and those who do not succumb must necessarily possess minds strong beyond the generality of woman-kind.
A home education is preferable in every respect. The influences that surround the recipients are pure—the salutary effects of home culture are beyond dispute, an in every way it is right and proper. Parents know the evils of boarding schools too well to need being reminded of facts so patent.
