“Something for Barnum—Our Own Proposition”
We propose that Barnum be recalled from his private business in Europe, and sent to Utah, as Governor, with plenary power. We don’t know whether or no President Buchanan is a regular reader of the Brooklyn Daily Times—but if he should not be so fortunate, we hope some of the officials hereabout will send him this number.
Appoint Barnum to Utah! we repeat it. What’s the use of the authorities posting off there, (at great expense) such a lot of “sojers?” Once armed force, murders, wrongs, and who knows the result? The fox will answer for Utah, better than the bear or lion. There’s many a wise proposition made in jest.
Besides something should be done for Barnum; he has passed middle age, and he is poor. Who says the country owes nothing to Barnum? We contend he is not only an American “representative man,” but a great original—just as great in his way as any of the most famous characters of the world are in theirs. Barnum’s plans were so vast! even his humbug had sublimity! Nothing of the pistareen about him—but large, like a fifty dollar gold piece.
Not for his own sake, however, do we solemnly propose that Barnum should be invested with the Governorship of Utah. It might not be a comfortable berth for him; and the “Danites” might at last pop out his life. But we think it a grand appointment for the United States.
