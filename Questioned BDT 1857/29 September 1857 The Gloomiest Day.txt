“The Gloomiest Day”
Of the present financial crisis, yesterday was the gloomiest day. In our edition of yesterday afternoon we chronicled further details of the state of things in various quarters, but they give us no comfort. The smash is general. There has been nothing like it since the dismal times of ’37.
Nothing else is, of course, talked of. Men discuss it everywhere in terms of apprehension and utter panic. In offices, in bar-rooms, in the street, it is the only topic. As the news of suspension after suspension comes in with startling rapidity, the feeling of insecurity increases, and the mercantile classes are reeling under the successive shocks thus dealt out upon the credit system.
The leading journals assume, we perceive, rather a more cheerful tone, in view of the matter, than generally pervades the mass of the community, but all agree that a Bank suspension in New York would add the last weight to the burden that is weighing upon us, and would be followed by an immediate prostration of the interests of the entire country without a parallel in our history. But as yet, strong in specie, and armed with vastly greater strength than the “provincial” institutions, they show no signs of giving out. We trust that our latest despatches will confirm us in the hope.
It is well that amid the wreck of banking institutions throughout the principal states, the Savings Banks are perfectly safe. Panic’s have arisen again and again, since the establishment of those institutions, but they have, by the system of careful management under which they have always been conducted, uniformly come out firm and sound as ever. Their investments are of the most reliable character and they are subject to none of the fluctuations which other institutions are liable to, and so long as grass grows and water runs, they will retain their security.
