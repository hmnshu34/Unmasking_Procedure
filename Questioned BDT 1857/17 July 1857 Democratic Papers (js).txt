“Democratic Papers”
	Some people say that the New York Daily Times is squinting towards the position of a Democratic party organ. Well, some of its articles do have that look a little; but it may be because the writers are independent, and cheerfully give credit where they think credit due. 
	The Democrats have bad luck with their newspapers—also with their monthly magazines. A destiny seems to impend over them, to become in a short time the mere mouthpieces of cliques, without any freedom at all—the registers of “Committees” and of the little and large party platforms.
	The Evening Post is the only democratic newspaper we know of that has save itself from this profitless degradation—for it is sure to be profitless in the long run. The Democratic Review, which was started fifteen years ago, and continued in a high tone, with the very best literary qualifications, has long dwindled to be the tender of office-hunters, and a receptacle of dry verbosity.
	We hope the New York Times will turn itself into a democratic organ. One is very much needed in the metropolis—a leading one, we mean. It is a shame that a strong and successful party has, year after year, no powerful and good principled advocate and expounder in a city like New York. Probably that is one reason the party has fallen into the hands of such persons as Fernando Wood—fallen to be nothing better than “Dead Rabbits.”
