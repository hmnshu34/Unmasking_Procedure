“Woman’s Wrongs”
Woman in the 19th century seems to be in a most lamentable, unsettled condition. People of Rutland the other day were excited by the proceedings of the Woman’s Rights Convention held in that sober and quiet town. They well might be astonished at the language of the prohibition introduced by Mrs. Branch, declaring that the degradation of women proceeds from the institution of marriage; that by the marriage contract she loses the control of her name, her person, her property, her labor, her affections, her children and her freedom.
Most women, it is believed, are satisfied with the results of the marriage relation; but it is evident that it bears upon Mrs. Branch with a crushing weight. Women, in general, do not feel degraded by the bestowal of their love upon one man; Mrs. Branch prefers a wider field for the play of woman’s affections. Most wives would rather their children should rightfully be called by the name of their husbands, but Mrs. Branch has no objection to her children claiming a plurality of fathers.
But there seems to be little prospect of the relief of Mrs. Branch. A serious obstacle to the realization of her ideas of “freedom” stands in the way. She rashly consented to be the wife of Mr. Branch, and the constitution prohibits any violation of contracts!
She must remain Mrs. Branch in spite of the oppression and slavery to which she is subjected. If the Free Love principle is to prevail at all, it must be prospective in its operation, and not inure to the benefit of any woman who has voluntarily taken upon herself this yoke of bondage.
We are afraid that in the present stage of civilization and in the present state of society nothing can be done for Mrs. B. She is one of the unfortunate ones who are in advance of her age. Like her great namesake “Alligator” Branch in New York, she must wait for a time, for it seems the world is not far enough advanced for either of them.
