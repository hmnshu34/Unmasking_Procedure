“All Humbug”
Yesterday the Herald undertook to show by statistics that there were upwards of 25,000 tailors thrown out of employ in New York. We have ascertained from a gentleman who knows that this is all sheer humbug. Mr. Reporter visits these wholesale clothing houses and is put off with any story with the ingenuity of his informant may choose to invent. No wholesale clothing house retains permanently any regular number of hands—sometimes they employ few, sometimes many, according to the necessities of their trade. When these houses are driven they will, for the purpose of securing additional help, establish depots in the midst of journeymen tailor’s residences, and there have been several such in the 16th ward of this city. The trade is very much depressed just now, as is every other, but the number out of employ is exaggerated. To show the unreliability of these statistics we have only to say that the reporter of the Herald entered the store of our informant, and in the absence of any proprietors was told by the boy that they usually employed 1500 hands, but owing to the dull times the firm had been necessitated to discharge 500. When asked why he did this, the boy replied: “Oh, I know all the others in the trade were cutting it fat, and I thought it wouldn’t do for us to be behind.”
So with the cloakmakers. The Evening Post had a table exhibiting the greatest distress in the cloak trade, which was in a great measure all bosh. Houses that employ one cutter and perhaps 16 girls, were put down as employing 16 cutters and 400 girls, and so on.
We all know things are bad enough, but why indulge in such “wasteful and ridiculous excess” in attempting to depict them.
