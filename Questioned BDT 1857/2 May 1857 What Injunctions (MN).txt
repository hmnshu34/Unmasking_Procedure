“What Injunctions May Effect”
Another injunction has been issued, namely, by Judge Birdseye, on application of Richard S. Roberts, of Brooklyn, restraining Comptroller Flagg from paying Mayor Wood’s legal expenses. It is also said that the Governor will call an extra session of the Legislature if the new laws are pronounced unconstitutional.
Fernando Wood nullified the Police law by deposing that he feared its effect would be injurious to his property interests. If Tom, Dick or Harry may suspend the action of a law by swearing that they believe its operation will damage their property, why may not any grocery keeper serve an injunction on the License Commissioners; or any slave owner forever keep “Abolitionists” out of the Presidential chair, by applying to Chief Justice Taney, who would doubtless be willing to oblige him, according to the precedent set by Judge Davies.
If the legal point involved in the action of Wood vs. Draper, be decided in the Mayor’s favor, the appointment of the Water Commissioners for Brooklyn, of the Washington Park Commissioners, and several other enactments affecting the interests of this city, will be similarly rendered nugatory.
