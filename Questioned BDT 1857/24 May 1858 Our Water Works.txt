“Our Water Works”
	The Sunday Mercury, speaking of the laying of the water pipes through our Brooklyn streets, says:
In a few months the gushing stream will be dancing along this subterranean path, murmuring its own song of imprisonment, and dashing impetuously out, when manumitted by the hydrant, in a burst of joyous brightness scattering jewels in the sunlight for all who can appreciate the precious, without the value or change. But will those ponds furnish a continuous and sufficient supply? Or will Brooklyn yet have to come to New York for the Croton after expending so much in this independent experiment? That’s the rub! How will a twelvemonth hence answer this delicate question?
	Yes, indeed, sir. When our works are finished, and the “liquid tide” runs through them, we shall not only have enough to supply a city of 230,000 inhabitants—our present population, be it remembered—but the works can easily be added to, to make a capacity for a city of a million people. And when we reach that latter figure, we can bring in a large further addition still. Truly, in short terms, the water supply for Brooklyn, through these works, can be recruited indefinitely, according to whatever quantity is wanted.
