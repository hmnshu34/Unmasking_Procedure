“Blackwood’s Magazine”
We have received the September number of Leonard Scott & Co.’s reprint of this first-class serial. Blackwood maintains the even tenor of its way, and rarely evinces the least falling off in point of ability. “Military Education,” the leading article, is timely and well-written. Bulwer’s new novel, “What will he do with it?” is continued. We shall want to read more of this before pronouncing on its merits. It tone is quite in the vein of the “Caxtons.” “The Book of the Rocks” is an exceedingly orthodox reconciliation of the Mosaic account with geological discoveries. “Scenes of Clerical Life,” and “New Sea Side Studies” are rather heavy reading. “Memoranda from the Manzanares,” is lively and entertaining, giving a capital picture of Spanish life. “The Bengal Mutiny,” which winds up the number, is an excellent resume of the Indian question.
