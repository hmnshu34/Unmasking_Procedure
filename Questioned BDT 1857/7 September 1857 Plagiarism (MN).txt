“Plagiarism”
PLAGIARISM.—Saturday’s Star comes down upon an unlucky literary thief in a manner worthy of Poe, the “Literary Mohawk,” himself. In other words, it devotes three columns to prove that Mr. Genio C. Scott, a tailor who scribbles a weekly column of rubbish for the man-milliner’s organ, the Home Journal, is a sad plagiarist as well as an ass. Now nobody who ever read the articles in question could for a moment doubt the latter proposition, and as for the first, it is a matter of so little consequence as not to be worth the space spent in demonstrating it. Le jeu ne vaut pas la chandelle.
