“The British Magazines”
	We call attention to the advertisement of Messrs. Leonard Scott and Co.’s cheap reprints of the British Magazines. They republish the four Quarterlies and Blackwood from advance sheets, nearly as soon as the original issue, and offer the whole at $10 yearly, the original price in Great Britain being more than three times that amount. From the detailed notices we have made of each magazine as received, our readers must be familiar with the character and merits of these worldfamed periodicals; and we need therefore now say no more than point out the advisability of parties wishing to become subscribers for all or any of the publications, sending in their names to the publishers forthwith, so as to commence with the new year.
