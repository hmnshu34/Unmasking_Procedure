“A Substitute for Primaries”
Postmaster Peck and others of the Kings County Democratic Association have drawn up a plan for preventing fraud in primary elections. There are several good minor features in it—for instance, requiring the name of each voter, forbidding primaries to be held at a liquor store, &c. But so long as the inspectors are appointed by committees, most of whom are generally themselves candidates for nominations, there is little hope for a fair count of the ballots. But the leading and best feature of the new plan is that it does away with the collections of strikers and suckers known as nominating conventions, by directing the electors in primary meetings to vote directly for the candidate they prefer, the one having most votes in the district to be the nominee. We cannot too strongly commend this idea: all that is needed beside it, to make nominations a perfect reflex of the wishes of the party at large, is to secure an honest and impartial set of inspectors and clerks.
