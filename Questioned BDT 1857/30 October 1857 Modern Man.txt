“[Modern Man Not Beyond the Ancients]”
The longer men live the greater reason they have to conclude either that the ancients were not so ignorant, superstitious and unprincipled as we are find of thinking, or that, at all events, the moderns are not a great way beyond them. The farther a traveler goes the more does he become convinced that the strange habits and startling customs he sees are only strange to him, and startle merely because they differ from ours; that, in fact, they are necessities of the climate, the region, the time; that it is as great a social crime in the tropics to be dirty as in commercial Wall street to forge a bill; that it is as impious to eat pork in the pestilential heats of India as to steal a Bible in a Protestant church; that the suttee, which in treacherous Hindostan makes a man’s wives responsible for his life by their own, stands on the same policy as that which protected masters in Rome from assassins among their slaves. The Turk in his harem reads the records of our wife-beatings, divorces, seductions and prostitutions, and with the whiff from his pipe mutters, “These be your Christian husbands!” The decrepit nabob who buys the pretty daughter of poverty, laughs at the Circassians who take his women to the slave market. Every age and people are barbarous, ignorant and unprincipled but our own, the fact being that they are only so in a different way from our own. It was augury, the oracle, the entrails of beasts or flight of birds; it was alchemy, astrology, witchcraft, palmistry; it is unknown tongues, Swedenborg, mesmerism, spirit-rapping, fortune-telling, Mormonism, weeping statues and the Immaculate Conception.
