“Immigrant Changes”
Serious changes are slowly but surely being accomplished in all that results from the immigration of foreign-born persons into the United States. The flood is not so large as it was, and its main sources are changed. In time to come the currents will decrease still more, and the continent of Europe, especially the German Empire, will furnish the majority, and give our foreign immigration its most marked character.
Our readers will doubtless be interested in the following statistics, from a late official compilation:
Arrival of Passengers in 1856
States				Males		Females		Total
Maine				857		524			1,381
New Hampshire			19		8			28
Massachusetts			10,872		8,358			19,220
Rhode Island			49		50			99
New York			97,492		64,616			162,105
Pennsylvania			4,724		3,726			8,453
Maryland			3,235		2,888			6,128
Virginia				13		2			15
South Carolina			497		241			738
Florida				157		266			739
Alabama			93		37			138
Louisiana			11,048		7,710			18,757
Texas				814		762			1,575
California			5,433		230			5,669
_________________________________________________________________
Total				135,308	99,188			224,496
Of the total number there were born in Germany, 63,807; Ireland, 54,349; England, 25,904; United States, 24,060; Great Britain and Ireland, 14,881; France, 7,246; Prussia, 7,221; British America, 6,493; China, 3,733; Wales, 8,297; Scotland, 3,297. The number of aliens arrived was 200,436. Died on the passage, 400.
Now these 200,000 persons of foreign birth arriving here, intending to settle permanently, cannot (one will at once surmise) in any way seriously affect the character of a nation of thirty millions of people. These aliens, in the very act of coming, show that vital energy and desire to better their condition, which is an argument that they will be something of an accession; besides which they quite all fetch with them a certain quantity of worldly goods, and some ready money. They infuse themselves through the North and West (seldom going South, except some Germans, into Texas), and give an impetus to land-sales, labor, agriculture, manufactures, &c.
We remember well the looks of about two hundred Scotch emigrants, at Castle Garden, the other day. They were healthy, clean, well clothed, “canny,” and in every respect had a substantial, strong, upright appearance. They were all bound west.
Of course we cannot receive all the benefits of foreign immigration, without some drawbacks. But the wisest statesmen of America have always seen that our country easily absorbs immigrants, and that the evils they bring in their train are temporary—while the good bears fruit for centuries. Such statesmen have, also, no doubt, forseen the results now in course of being accomplished, viz: that the great tide of foreign emigration would duly subside, and then, for succeeding years, would be only a partial and moderate stream.
This result will be plain from the following table, which contains the number of passengers arrived in the United States, during the last ten years:
Years			Males		Females	Sex not stated		Total
1847			186 128		92 883		472			229 483
1848			179 256		119 915		512			299 682
1849			200 904		116 392		1,038			315 334
1850			38 282		27 107		181			65 570
1851			245 017		163 745		66			408 828
1852			215 731		160 174		1,438			397 343
1853			236 782		164 178		72			400 982
1854			284 887		175 587		--			460 474
1855			140 161		90 283		12			230 476
1856			135 308		39188		--			224496
We have only to add that the total number of passengers arriving in the United States, for the last thirteen years is 3,635,460. This is at the rate of 280,000 a year. 
We then derive two important points as settled. It is clear that the great rush of immigration from abroad is over, and that what is to come, in future, will be from the continent of Europe.
