“Washington Park”
	This beautiful ground is now covered with rich verdure, and is one of the pleasantest resorts anywhere around. On its lofty tops you feel the breeze, and from them behold one of the finest views in the world. Most of the trees are yet too young to cast much shade, but they are growing finely.
	We recollect there was a very obstinate and indignant opposition to the securing of these noble grounds, some twelve years since, when the project was mooted before the Common Council and the public. It was argued that Brooklyn was not rich enough to stand the expense of purchase; and that it would be better to let the “old fort” be dug away, and blocked up with buildings.
	Fortunately these counsels did not prevail. A more far-sighted policy, (after a contest something like that upon the Sunday cars,) carried the day.
	Is there any one left of those who so furiously opposed Washington Park, who is not now glad that his opposition did not succeed?
