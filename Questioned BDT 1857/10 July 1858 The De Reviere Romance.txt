“The De Reviere Romance—Williamsburgh Interested in the Matter”
Something new has turned up in the De Reviere romance. It appears that yesterday the gallant captain was the recipient of the following “little bill” which speaks for itself:
BROOKLYN. R.D., Wednesday, July 7, 1857. Capt. HENRI ARNOUX DE REVIERE
TO 5.D. GOODENOW, Proprietor of the Wall House, Fourth Street, Williamsburgh. Dr.
For board and lodging for self and wife to date ….$226.50
Received payment.
It is stated concerning the history of this interesting document, that De Reviere, while in this city in 1857, put up at the Wall House in 4th St, in company with a young lady whom he called his wife and who lived with him as such. Scandal got abroad and finally—so the story goes—he was induced to marry her.
On his departure from Williamsburgh, on the 7th of July, 1857, De Reviere gave Mr. Goodenow a draft on a house in London for the amount of his bill. This, however, returned protested, as the Captain had unfortunately neglected to keep an account in the establishment on which he drew the check.
We are afraid the chances for collecting the two hundred and odd dollars are rather dubious.
The young woman is said to be at present located in the small village of Philadelphia, a Catholic Priest having become interested in her. De Riviere seems to be a compound of Don Juan and Jeremy Diddler.
