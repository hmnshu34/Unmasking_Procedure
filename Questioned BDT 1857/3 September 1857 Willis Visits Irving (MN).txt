“Willis Visits Irving”
WILLIS VISITS IRVING.—N.P.W. is one of the perennials. Age does not injure him; custom cannot stale his infinite variety. We think it was Fanny Osgood who used to say that she hoped Willis and Morris would live forever and always edit a paper. Probably there are plenty of other ladies who have thought the same thing. 
Nathaniel has been visiting Irving. He found him in capital spirits, and talks of his “free and easy step, pliant motion and admirable spontaneousness.” He says “he has the presence of a man half his age.” In answer to inquiries, Irving said he sometimes worked fourteen hours a day, and “thought he should die in harness.” He “never had a headache.” Ah, the present generation of literary men are different—how different! What a falling off is there, young scribblers!
