“The Monroe Obsequies”
Yesterday Virginia did tardy notice to one of her most illustrious sons. The procession and ceremonies are noticed by some of the New York papers with a great flourish of trumpets, but we cannot avoid thinking that the affair fell far short of a proper memorial to the virtues of one “in the presence of whom relied,” to use the language of a contemporary, “we should stand uncovered and respectful.” The pageant was a very meagre one, falling short of what was expected. Comparatively, few of our citizen soldiery ___ out. If the occasion had been an ovation to James Buchanan, instead of a demonstration of respect for departed worth, there would have been an immense turn-out. As it was, however, the demonstration was little else than a ___.
At the procession we noticed Col. Duryea and Col. Abel ___, of this city; also Mr. ___ M. Marsh, of the Board of Education, and ___ M. Gale, Esq.
