    For the last fifty years, famine, pestilence, and murder, have been no new things in Ireland. Those terrific results, in this case, of a bad government, (aye, for so they are, in spite of all your talk about ‘‘visitations of Providence’’) have made a trinity of wretchedness, many a time and oft, in poor Erin—and, if the present relations with ‘‘the
5    Saxon’’ continue to exist, no man who knows the true exigencies of the case may reasonably hope that the same wretchedness can be lessened.

[Literary Notice]


    The January number of Hunts’ Merchants’ Magazine, contains an interesting article on the subject of the seat of government of the United States.—While we could not
15    altogether agree with the positions taken in the article, it is undoubtedly written with ability, and contains many interesting reminiscences. . . . . . . Hunt’s magazine should be taken and read by every business man.
