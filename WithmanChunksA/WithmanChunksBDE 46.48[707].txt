the harbor, we have yet to learn; and we must say the blundering of one side is more
inexplicable to us, than the treachery of the other.

East Long Island Correspondence: [Letter III]
25
    Southold, Sept. 14th.—Seeing, to-day, as I passed one of the country stores, a real Indian, (at least as far as there are any of that race, now-a-days; that is, perhaps, an Indian whose blood is only thinned by two or three degrees of mixture,) my thoughts were turned toward the aboriginal inhabitants of this island. A populous and powerful race! for such they once were. Some authorities assert that, at the earliest approach of  30 the whites to this part of the continent, and for a time after, the Indian inhabitants of Long Island numbered a million and a half. This may be an over-estimate; but the red race here was certainly very numerous, as is evidenced by many tokens. ‘‘An ancient Indian,’’ says one tradition, ‘‘more than a hundred years ago, declared to one of the earliest inhabitants of Easthampton, that within his recollection the natives were as  35 many as the spears of grass. And if, said he, stretching his hands over the ground, you
can count these, then, when I was a boy, you could have reckoned their number.’’
