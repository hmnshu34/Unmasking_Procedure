sinecures; that thousands of excisemen, with good salaries, might ostensibly protect the
starving linen-weavers of the north of Ireland.
This oppressive impost is now replaced by the income tax—by those who are able
to pay it. But during the greater part of a century these ardent protectionists, (the

The Principles We Fight For


Jefferson lays down the following principles:
45
The People—the only source of legitimate power.
The absolute and lasting severance of Church from State.

  	37


The freedom, sovereignty, and independence of the respective States.
The Union—a confederacy, a compact, neither a consolidation, nor a centralization.
The Constitution of the Union; a special grant of powers, limited and definite.
The civil paramount to the military power.
The representative to obey instructions of his constituents.	5
Election free, and suffrage universal.
No hereditary office, nor order, nor title.
No taxation beyond the public wants.
No national debt, if possible.
No costly splendor of administration.	10
No proscription of opinion, nor of public discussion.
No unnecessary interference with individual conduct, property, or speech.
