In some respects all boys are alike. All eat, and drink, and sleep. All wish to be thought manly,
and think they are so. Now if they could agree in opinion as to what is and what is not manly in
15    thought, feeling and action, there would be much greater similarity of character among  them.
Most boys are in ignorance, and what is still worse, many of them are in error, as to the real
difference between the man and the boy. A large majority evidently sigh to be twenty-one, only
for the sake of doing as they please, which is to them the sumum bonum of this world, and the
characteristic  between  the  man  and  the  boy.  Governed  by  this  conviction,  they  often  seek
20    occasion to display this hostility to government as the best proof of early manhood. Alas! how
perfect their delusion. If they could but be enlightened on this point, and be content with the
simple discharge of what they know to be their daily duty, men might soon be properly defined
‘‘taller boys,’’ and boys ‘‘shorter  men.’’
