Perhaps it galls them: it certainly arouses their malignance. Yet why should it?  30
Why should they not record, with pride, the great courage and dauntless bravery, and
unequalled perseverance, of their descendants?

The Same Subject Continued


All through the morning, the same heavy and thick fog has continued to envelope
this section of the world.—Ding–g–g! ding–g–g! ding–g–g! go the ferry bells to give  40
boats notice where they must come in.

[An Emerson Paragraph]


    In one of Ralph Waldo Emerson’s inimitable lectures, occurs the following striking paragraph, which every heart will acknowledge to be as truthful as it is beautiful:
    
382	  


    ‘‘When the act of reflection takes place in the mind, when we look at ourselves in the light of thought, we discover that our life is embosomed in beauty. Behind us,  as we go, all things assume pleasing forms, as clouds do afar off. Not only things familiar and stale, but even the tragic and terrible, are lures of memory. The river  bank, the weed at the water side, the old
5    house, the foolish person, however neglected at the passing, have a grace in the past. Even the corpse that has lain in the chambers, has added a solemn ornament to the house.—The soul will not know either deformity or pain.’’
