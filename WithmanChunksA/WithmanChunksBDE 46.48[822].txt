Broad Farce in Literature—‘‘The John-Donkey’’

In advance, we have been supplied by the polite conductors with the initiative
15    number of (for Jan. 1, ’48,) ‘‘the John-Donkey,’’ a new quarto illustrated journal of

on this side of the Atlantic—and he don’t attempt (which was the great fault of the late
‘‘Yankee Doodle,’’) to swim in the wake of the London and Paris comic papers. We
welcome the new print, and would encourage it to persist, unflaggingly, in efforts
equal to this first number—because, if it does, it will surely establish itself, and ‘‘pay.’’
