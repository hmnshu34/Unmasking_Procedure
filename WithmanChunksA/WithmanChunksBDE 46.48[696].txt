its rurality, something of a fever-and-aguish aspect, which I should hardly like to live in the midst of, more than long enough to visit my hospitable friend W., at his cottage there.	10
    East New York comes next on the line. This settlement is quite a flat. To the north rises a spur of that range of hills which runs nearly through the island; and gives the settlement a relief from the character of monotony which most flat places possess. East New York was going to be, once, a very great city, and arrangements were made on a corresponding scale to have it so. A post office was established, also a school and  15 church, ditto a ‘‘land agency’’; after which there was some talk of a bank—(all this was years ago, in the ‘‘speculation times,’’)—and your humble servant himself was spoken
to about going there and establishing a newspaper.—Numerous lots were sold, and buildings erected.—The place did really offer a pretty natural situation, and the land presenting no obstacle to convenience of every kind in the way of forming a village,  20 golden dreams were paramount in the heads of more than its principal proprietor, Mr. Pitkin. But alas! like all the false business that was superinduced by the poisonous influence of the United States bank, and the paper speculators of those days, the bubble burst at last—and East New York almost burst with it. I observe that some clusters of buildings are still there, and most of them seem to be occupied. But the  25 whole village is devoid of that aspect of vitality which notes a thriving and growing place, where the inhabitants are ‘‘making money.’’
