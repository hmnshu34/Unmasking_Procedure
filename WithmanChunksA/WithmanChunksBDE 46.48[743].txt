has a right to call himself a democrat, and either wish for, or do for, the triumph of the whigs. More than that, it is to be remembered that passiveness in voting for the right is almost  10 as bad as activity in voting for the wrong. If there be any democratic reader of this article, who, for any cause, has felt a willingness to let himself be absent from the polls, and help the whigs through not voting for the democrats, we conjure him in the most serious manner to weigh well such a course, before he allows himself to pursue it. It is
by such a course, if pursued by any number of people, that we may expect to lose our ticket. The  15 circumstances of our party, now, are such that every true man must come up to the mark!

Rouse and Come Forth!


    Yes; rouse and come forth, democrats of Long Island! for your cause is in danger! Whatever be the end, your duty is plain—to work actively, and till the last moment, in  25 behalf of your principles and your candidates. To most of you, this work will merely consist in going to the polls and voting; a simple half hour ’s job, at most—and with many of you a mere ten minutes’ job. But how wide and far extending the conse- quences of such votes! The success of our cause depends upon them—the putting down of the corrupt and anti-American faction of whiggery that opposes us!	30
