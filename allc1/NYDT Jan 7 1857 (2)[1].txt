	Thus, for half a century, England has striven continually, but rarely with success to establish her preponderance in the Cabinet of the Persian Shahs. The latter, however, are a match for their wheedling foes, and squirm out of such treacherous embrace. Aside from having under her eyes English dealing in India, the Persians very likely keep in view this advice, given to Feth-ali Shah, in 1805: "Distrust the counsel of a nation of greedy mer- "chants, which in India traffics with the lives "and crowns of sovereigns." Set a thief to catch a thief. In Teheran, the capital of Persia, English influence is very low; for, not counting Russian in-trigues there, France occupies a prominent standing, and of the three fillibusters, Persia may most dread the British. At the present moment an embassy from Persia is on the way to or has already reached Paris, and there very likely the Persian complication will be the subject of diplo-matic disputes. France, indeed, is not indifferent to the occupation of the island in the Persian Gulf. The question is rendered yet more knotty by the fact that France disentombs some buried parch-ment by which Karneg has already been twice ceded to her by the Persian Shahs--one so far back as in 1708, under Louis XIV, and then in 1808--on both occasions conditionally, it is true, but in terms sufficient to constitute some rights, or justify pretensions from the present imitator of those sov-ereigns, who were sufficiently anti-English.
