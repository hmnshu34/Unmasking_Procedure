Wednesday, March 4, 1857. Poor Pierce! Alallelujah! We have reached the last day of poor Pierce’s administration. At twelve o’clock this day, the worst of the United States Presidents will retire into private life-we fervently hope, to enjoy the plantation which the Virginians propose-and no doubt will remember-to give him.
A sorry record is Franklin Pierce’s! Four years now, since he read that flaming inaugural, in which he annexed Cuba, bullied England, patted Mexico on the back, and locked up and laid clear out of sight and out of mind that dirty slavery quarrel; and what have they brought forth? As to foreign affairs, the only war he has carried on has been against the large, powerful, and formidable community of Greytown: the only quarrel of any consequence, is a small, mean, dirty quarrel into which he got us with England about a few ragamuffins whom John Bull wanted to hire for soldiers, whom Franklin Pierce wouldn’t part with on any account, and at whose palpably illegal departure for Nicaragua he has since found it convenient to wink. As to domestic affairs-starting in public life with a healthy, vigorous Union sentiment to bout him up-he has contrived, in his four years administration, to embitter the quarrel between North and South to an unexampled extent, and narrowly to escape breaking up the confederacy. He has satisfied no one, and disgusted all. The fourth of March ought to be a welcome day to Franklin Pierce!
