The City Court

January 28th, 1857

	It was thought when Louis Napoleon demolished the French Republic at a blow and had himself declared the supreme ruler of France, with his will for the law, that he had performed a considerable feat.  We have in this city an individual who exceeds the ambition of Napoleon in his own petty way, as far as his dwarfish and grovelling nature falls behind his prototype in the power of executing his designs.  We hope our readers did not fail to peruse the two acts and the other abstracts of acts published yesterday in our Albany correspondence.  If any have neglected the duty we hope they will repair the omission by studying the acts in questions.  They will see in those acts the designs of the individual who now prostitutes the City Court to be the tool of political tricksters, and makes it a gag and handcuff to stuff in the mouth and tic the hands of any public officer who may stand in the way of hungry office beggars.
	One of these acts provides for the creation of a sinecure office, to be called a Commissioner of Jurors, who is to be appointed by the City Judge with the aid of the President of the Common Council and Auditor, or any one of them ; the said officer to have a magnificent salary and the privilege of appointing as many Deputies as he pleases to help him to do nothing.  What particular individuals are designed to have their wants supplied by this law are probably best known to its author.
