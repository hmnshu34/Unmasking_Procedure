Thursday, January 15, 1857. Position and Prospects of Walker. By the arrival of the steamship George Law from Aspinwall a few days later intelligence has been received from Nicaragua than we possessed. It will be remembered that our latest dates from General Walker were to the 1st December, at which time he was on board of the steamer Virgin with a few men; a part of his forces were holding Virgin Bay and San Juan del Bar, a part were besieged in the church of Guadalupe, and his sick and wounded had been removed to the island of Ometepe. in the center of Lake Nicaragua, where, it was stated, the Indians had massacred them. At this date the partisans of Walker were confident that General Henningsen would be able to maintain his defense in the Guadalupe church until relieved, for which purpose Walker awaited the arrival of recruits, then on their way up from San Juan del Norte. 
The advices we have now received are to the 5th of December, from Rivas by way of Costa Rica, and the 8th of same month from San Juan del Sur by way of San Francisco. We dispose of the latter portion of the news very summarily. It contradicts itself in stating that the fighting in Nicaragua is over, and that Walker went up on the 6th to attack Rivas, and on the next day was attacked by the enemy on the lake shore. The only inference we can draw from the advices to the 8th, carried by the Orizaba from San Juan del Sur to San Francisco, is that up to that date Walker had me with no serious reverse.
