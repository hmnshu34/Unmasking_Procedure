But, again, during the month which has been expended in this party debate at Washington, among the Presidential campaigners, the spoilsmen of the lobby have not been idle. They have been setting their traps, laying their pipe, buying up vote, and arranging their plans, in both house and outside, for putting through their various schemes of spoliation and plunder. Therefore, with poor Pierceâ€™s Message out of the way, which has answered their purposes most admirably, we hope those lobby conspirators and their corrupt affiliations will be locked after in each house by an active Committee of Vigilance.
