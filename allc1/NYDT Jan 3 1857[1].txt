	The Bulletin, however, fails to comprehend the full force of its own suggestions; or, at least, to give expression to it. That journal finds the great danger to the institution of Slavery not so much in the agitation into which so many Southern politicians are busy in throwing the minds at once of the slaves and the masters--the old proverb holding good in this case, life master like man--as in certain a certain section of the non-slaveholding white population, "vicious men who demoralize the negroes, and "render them as depraved and worthless as them- "selves, by furnishing them liqour in order to ob- "tain their money." "Thus brutalized," says The Bulletin, "and rendered insensible and reckless, "they naturally become insensible and reckless, "they naturally become intractable and fit for any "deeds, however ferecious." The Crescent com-plains, on the other hand, in extravagent terms, of the extreme laxity of discipline, and of the over indulgence with which the slaves are treated, calling fiercelt for Draconian laws if neccessary, against both black and white, to enforce the needed severity. "All the black codes of the Southern States de-"mand remodeling," shouts The Crescent, "and in "reframing them there must be no sickly sentimen-"tality." The Picayune thinks the great danger is from "an incendiary philanthropy," operating upon and through the numerous free colored population of the city, and it calls loudly for a revision of the laws, principally with a view to new re-straints upon that class of the population.
