The Inauguration

March 4th, May 1857

	The inauguration of a President of a powerful and aspiring Republic is at all times an important event; but the installation of MR. BUCHANAN to-day will rivet more interested attention than similar events usually arouse.  The announcement of his views of public policy will be eagerly looked for, not only among our own people, but in Great Britain it will be discussed in every political coterie;  while it will be translated into a dosen languages on the continent of Europe, and perused intently in all.
	We have no fear that the dismal and croaking prophecies which preceded the election, and which predicted the most awful ravages of fiilibusterism, slavery, and other phantoms, in case of his election, will be fulfilled.  On the contrary there is not a sensible man of any party who does not look hopefully forward for four years of peace and prosperity; or, if disturbance, foreign or domestic, must arise, to see the country carried bravely and honorable through it.  The people have the highest confidence in the prudence, ability, and patriotism of the experienced statesman whom they elected President.
	Immense numbers have gone to Washington to witness the Inaugural.  Every State and every considerable city has sent its deputation.  There will be many whose most ardent hopes will be for the success of the new government ; others who have been drawn by idle curriosity ; and not a few politicians who have gone to have their own axes ground ; who are enthusiastic and vociforous patriots, but if denied in what they seek, will leave Washington the bitterest enemies of the government.
