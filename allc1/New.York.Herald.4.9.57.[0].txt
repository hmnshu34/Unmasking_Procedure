Thursday, April 9, 1857. Who Murdered Dr. Burdell! We see with amazement, in the columns of the Evening Post and the Tribune, statements alleging that the counsel of Mr. Eckel and Mrs. Cunningham have discovered the murderer of Dr. Burdell, and are aware of the means by which he achieved his befurious deed. We say we see this with amazement, because we have not heard either of any disclosures made by the counsel to the Grand Jury, or of the arrest of Mr. Clinton as an accessory after the fact. We presume the District Attorney does not read the Post or Tribune. We beg now to all his attention to the facts.
Of course if Mr. Clinton or the other counsel for the prisoners knows who did the deed, keeping that knowledge a secret is not only a palpable injustice to the unhappy man and woman who are now in confinement on a charge of murder, but is a plan defeat of the ends of justice. To keep the truth a secret in such a case is to hold out to the guilty a fair opportunity to escape, and to favor the punishment of the innocent. It is besides a direct perversion of the purpose of the law, which requires every man to do what in him lies to help the detection of the guilty. 
Mr. Clinton is likely to know law enough to be aware of the risk he has run in making, or in anthoriging these newspapers to make, this disclosure on his behalf. He will not therefore be taken by surprise should the District Attorney proceed with the legal steps indicted by the state of the facts. We have no doubt but he is already prepared not only with bail, but with ample and satisfactory reasons to account for his very singular course in abstaining from vindicating the character of his clients and bringing a murderer to justice.
