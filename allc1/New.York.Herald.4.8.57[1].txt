Newspapers published outside of New York, and especially in places like Washington where there is no trade, and no general industrial movement, usually seek support from the patronage of political friends. They agree to support such a party or such an individual in return for assistance either in the shape of money, or in the shape of sinecure offices to the editor, or in the shape of printing extravagantly overpaid. The last has been the stand-by of the Washington Union. For supporting its party in Congress, it has obtained the printing of the House of Representatives, giving its proprietors a profit of over $100,000 per Congress. They have published their newspaper as a luxury, and paid for it out of their profits. Whence of course, everyone knowing its wretched bargain, and the obligation it was under to puff every one who had voted for it, despised and contemned it; and had it been conducted even with more imbecility if that be possible-it would hardly have been a greater hindrance to its party, or a greater disgrace to the government which it was understood to represent.
