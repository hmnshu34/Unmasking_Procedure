	We should like to be informed under what au-thority and upon what grounds the official reporter of the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States entitles the opinion delivered by Chief Jus-tice Taney in the Dred Scott case “The opinion of the Court.” Mr. Chief Justice Taney delivered the judgement of the Court as concurred in by six Judges, which was that the case be sent back to the Court below to be dismissed for want of juris-diction, but the opinion which he delivered on that occasion was not, as to some its most remarka-ble points, the opinion of the Court, but only the opinion of Mr. Chief Justice Taney and a minor-ity of the Judges, and, therefore, under any point of view, totally destitute of binding authority. It is due to the credit of the Court, which has no rep-utation to spare, that it should be relieved from the damaging burden of the ignorance and misrepre-sentations of Taney. Wayne and Daniel, saddled upon it by this assumption that the scandalous per-versions of history and the false reasoning based upon these scandalous perversions emanated from the majority of the Court, when, in fact, they are indorsed by nobody except Taney, Wayne and Daniel. 
	Misled by the idea that Taney’s opinion was the opinion of the Court, it has been supposed that the point of authoritatively decided in this case, and the only point so decided, was, that negroes of African descent cannot be citizens of the United States; whereas, in point of fact, that idea was sustained by only three Judges against two—four being entirely silent upon it. It is true that these three Judges attempt to back themselves up by vouching in the opinions of Attorney-Generals Wirt and Cushing, and Judge Daggett of Connecticut; but, as neither of these three happens to be a Judge of the Supreme Court of the Unite States, they are still but a minority, and their opinion totally destitute of any authority as a de-cision of the Court, and depending solely for its weight with the profession on the coreectness of the facts that it assumes, and, admitting those facts, the justice of the deductions attempted to be drawn from them.
