	We must not conclude, however, without an expression of hope for the future. We have faith in human progress. Unquestionably, we are upon the eve of great events. Doubtless, the United States are destined to play no mean part in the drama to-day commenced. It is not impossible that the year before us may witness the settlement of the Cuban question, of the Central American question, of many questions which are now agitating the nations. Let us trust, in spite of the past, that this country may, in the controversies before it, show that re-gard for right and for honesty which no nation can with impunityforget. Let us trust that we may not be altogether false to our great missions. Let us hope that, placed by Providence in the van of human culture, we may not be found wanting in the battle waged for right and for the truth.
