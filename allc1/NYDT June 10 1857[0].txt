	The City Judge and the Mayor have recently made a large number of appointments to the Police in place, as they allege, of the men who have gone over to the regular Police Commissioners. Several persons have asked for the names of the men thus appointed, but all have been refused. The charac-ter of some of the appointees warrants the con-clusion that they are in the main not only unfit and unworthy to become the guardians of the people, but that a large proportion of them were preofes-sional thieves and vagabonds. We are assured that the emissaries of the Mayor recently visited all the rum-shops and loafing places in a certain Ward, drumming up recruits for his police or watch; that places were offered to anybody who would take them, but not a single man who possessed the means of subsistence in any tolerable degree would accept the offer. On Saturday night, while passing through the same Ward, we noticed one of the gang of thieves and bullies, who were bantering him upon his official character. “Wha-a-t!” says one, “you an M.P.? D—d if they ain’t getting’ all “the thieves in New-York on the Police;” and the new officer ran down the street, pursued by the jeers and taunts of his former confederates and companions. In other instances, persons dis-missed from the Department for grave offenses have been hunted up and restored to the Mayor’s favor. On Friday night, one of the Sixth Ward officers—a staunch supporter of the Mayor—while in a state of beastly drunkenness, kept up a row for half an hour at the corner of Broadway and White street, by boasting that he could whip any Irishman on the face of the earth. His language was disgustingly obscene and profane, such as ought to have caused his expulsion from the Department at the earliest possible moment.
