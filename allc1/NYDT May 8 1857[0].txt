	The Legislature of our State at its late Session was compelled to act on the subject of the location of the Quarantine connected with this port. It had become evident that the present location of the establishment, on that corner of Staten Island near-est our city, and where it is surrounded by dwell-ings and thronged streets, is no longer tolerable. It must be removed, but whither? Sandy Hook proffers the most eligible alternative—deep water, convenience to vessels entering our harbor, pure air, and isolation from population or business. But Sandy Hook is within the State of Camden and Amboy, whose legislators are unaccustomed to pass bills by which anybody else is to be benefited, without being themselves benefited in turn. It was soon made manifest that this location could not be had, unless by an exorbitant, unwarranted outlay, and that some spot within our own jurisdiction must be selected. The example of the dog in the manager had not been lost on the thrifty lawmakers of that State. The three Commissioners appointed—one of them a Staten Islander—by our State authorities to discover and designate the best attainable loca-tion, after due inquiry, decided in favor of a tempo-rary location on Seguine’s Point, on the southeast village or thronged thoroughfare, the ocean excepted. The Governor came down on purpose to examine this location, and approved it. An eligible property was purchased, and arrangements for a temporary Quarantine, to be devoted to patients suffering from yellow fever, or some other con-tagious and dangerous malady, were consummated.
