	Yellow fever found its wat from Quarantine to the Long Island shore last Summer. Did it get there by infected materials floating on shore at Bay Ridge, or by the poison being wafted from the ves-sels under Quarantine by southerly winds? The disease likewise made its appearance at Bergen Point, New-Jersey, and at Governor’s Island. Did the infection find its way to either of these points of places by southerly winders, or by floating infected materials? The proof is abundant, in answer to each of these questions, that the yellow fever, at each of these localities, originated from floating in=fected materials, and not from infection wafted by the agency of the winds from vessels on board of which pestilential disease had prevailed.
	The history of yellow fever, as it prevailed on Long Island last Summer, should be instructive in settling the question of the agency of the wind in carrying from point to point the infection of yellow fever. The disease, as every citizen knows, ap-peared at first within a few rods from shore; and, notwithstanding the winds blew for weeks in a di-rection inland, it was confined exclusively to the coast—not a case appearing at any considerable distance therefrom. If the wind can waft the poison of yellow fever from place to place, how can the above fact be explained? The truth is, and it is susceptible of proof, that the Long Island pesti-lence last Summer originated from refuse, infected materials thrown overboard, contrary to law, by vessels arribing in port. What is true and can be proved of the origin of the disease on the Long Island sore, is equally true of Bergen Point and the eastern shore of Staten Island, below Tomp-kinsville.
