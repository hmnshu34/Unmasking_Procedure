	The arrangement which we suggest would, beside its other recommendations, have the additional ad-vantage of holding out the promise of a satisfactory solution of the Women's Rights question. The most sturdy opponents of the claim which has been put forth of the right of women to vote do not deny that female influence may be legitimately excercised to a certain extent over public affairs; while, on the other hand, we are inclined to believe that the most sturdy advocates of the rights of women to a direct and personal participation in politics and legislation would be content to compromise for the quasi rep-resentation of their sex at Washington, in accordance with the scheme above set forth.
	Let us not, however, he understood as being ab-solutely commited to this plan. We throw it out for public discussion. Possibly there may exist some serious objection to it which has not oc-curred to us. We should like especially to hear what the women have to say to it, since all the ad-vantages which might be anticipated from it would fail to be realized unless it engaged their hearty cooperation.
