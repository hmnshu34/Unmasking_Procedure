Wednesday, January 14th, 1857. California Repudiates. The most important item of news by the George Law, arrived at this port yesterday, with a fortnight later advices from the Pacific, is the virtual repudiation of one State debt of California. The constitution of that State provides that the debt shall never exceed three hundred thousand dollars, but it appears that some of the official speculators have allowed it to increase to the amount of several millions, trusting to an amendment of the constitution to pay it. It will be remembered that our constitution had to be opened to raise the nine million canal loan, which we steadily opposed at the time. The organic law of a State is a sacred thing, and should not be altered or disturbed to put a few dollars in the pockets of small potato financiers. In California there has eeb an immense amount of official swindling, and the matter has been brought to a crisis by a decision of the Supreme Court declaring the unconstitutionality of a bill which passed the legislature last session, and which appropriates one hundred thousand dollars for a wagon road across the Sierra Nevada. This decision carries with it the unconstitutionality of all the State indebtedness over and above three hundred thousand dollars. The State bounds are held chiefly in the East, and the effect upon them will be distressing to the holders. They declined ten per in Wall street yesterday. No doubt the people of California will vote against repudiation, but the remedy is almost as bad as the disease.
