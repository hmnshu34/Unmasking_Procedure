	Whether the attendance of these officers is to enforce the edicts, sovereign ukases, and Napoleonic decrees of CULVER at the point of the bayonet, as Cromwell persuaded refractory parliaments ; or merely to maintain his august dignity and impress plebians with an idea of the grandeur that "doth hedge" CULVER, we cannot say
	The boundless munificence with which he strews around the dollars of the County is worthy of a Crœsus.  If he does condescend to rake a few of them into his own private till we ought to be the more thankful.  He cannot do less than have a carriage with its panels emblazoned with such armorial bearings as will inspire the vulgar people with a proper idea of what manner of man they have got among them and induce them to strip their heads and fall on their faces as he passes by.  The salary of the City Judge has heretofore been $2,500 per annum.-- This new law increases it to $4,000.  The Constiution forbids the increase of the salary of Supreme Court Judges and certain other officers during their term of office ; but this law elevates CULVER far above Supreme Court Judges and at the same time cuts away any penurious barriers that may stand between his vile rapacity and the public treasury.  These acts, be it remembered, all emanate from CULVER's own pen ; and it is a pity that usch a formality as Legislative sanction should be required to give them full effect.  A man of CULVER's calibre should have the power to make laws by his own mere proclamation.
