	For more than half a century, the Quarantine has been located at Staten Island. During this long period, yellow fever has often been communicated to the residents of the island, but those who have had an attack of the malady have either been per-sons who have had to do with infected vessels and cargoes, or those who have resided in proximity to the shore, where floating materials from the bay often find a lodgment. Staten Islanders, living even a few hundred rods from the bay, have never suffered from imported disease, no matter which way the wind may have blown, and no matter how often they may have passed or repassed to the city of New-York, through the range of infected vessels under quarantine. If the poison could have been wafted by the winds, at sundry times during the past half century, yellow fever would have pre-vailed as an epidemic throughout the entire island; but the fact that the island has not been visited by the pestilence, except on the shore and in the vicin-ity of the Quarantine, proves conclusively that the “wind hypothesis” is wind only. 
	The Commissioners for the removal of the Quar-antine Station are putting up temporary hospitals at Seguine’s Point. Much opposition is urged to the project, not only by the residents of the local-ity, but by some of the City papers, on the ground that, if yellow fever is brought on the island at that point, the winds will waft its poison thence to every man’s residence till it reaches even the City of New-York. This plea, in opposition to the removal of Quarantine, is a mere bugbear, promul-gated for the purpose of thwarting the efforts of the Quarantine Commissioners, and evidenlt with the view of adding to the excitement and desperate recklessness which already exist at Seguine’s Point among the misguided oystermen.
