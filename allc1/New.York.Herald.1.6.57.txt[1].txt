No sooner was California open to our people than its immense bilden wealth was brought to light, and soon poured a mighty stream of gold into the channels of the circulating medium throughout the world. New York received the greatest benefit, because it is the commercial centre of the country, and New York fortunes immediately expanded to amounts that but a few years since were fabulous among us. The example of California started Australia, and the Anglo-Saxon prospecter, with the experience acquired at Indian River, and other California localities, soon laid open the hidden treasures in the eastern shore of the Pacific. 
Those who think that this commercial movement has reached its culminating point, greatly mistake the signs of the times. It is but in its infancy, whether we view it in America, Africa or Asia. That the Anglo-Saxon phase of it will produce the greatest results everywhere, we do not doubt, for the movement is in accordance with the innate impulse of the race. Land and trade lie close to the Saxon heart, and twine around all its valves and arteries. When Mr. Fillmore, not the would-be President, but he who has been sent over here by the London Times to act as its special correspondent, said at the New England dinner, a few days since, that Great Britain and the United States were the two great branches of the Anglo-Saxon race, one moving west and the other east, till they should meet as friends upon the walls of China, be uttered a great Saxon truth. ANd when the sons of the Puritans who listened to him, applauded with wild enthusiasm, they bore witness to that truth, and unwittingly confessed the great impulse that underlies all the other strain of their hearts. That New England dinner, and that Britonâ€™s speech, were but the volcanic upheaving of the fires that burn in the Saxon bosom everywhere.
