	The Mayor is fully aware of the illegality of his appointments, as well as of their improper charac-ter; and he takes good care to clear his own skirts from responsibility in a pecuniary way, by telling the new men that their pay is a master over which he has no control; that he is not responsible for it, and cannot tell them whether they will ever get it. Doubtless, this is the principal reason why no man who can live otherwise will accept the cast-off stars. The badge of office, to some of the recent enlistments, however, is but another advantage to them. Instead of operating under the ban of the police, they reunite the tactics of thief and catch-pole—for what credit or protection to the people, the reader can easily imagine.
