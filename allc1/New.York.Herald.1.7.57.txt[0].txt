Wednesday, January 7th 1857. New Phase of the Cuban Slave Trade. We publish to-day a very curious plan for civilizing Africa and supplying Cuba with laborers, which has been proposed to the Spanish government by Senor Meana, in Havana. Our correspondents in that city inform us that this plan is rapidly growing in official favor there; but we learn from other quarters that the native Cubans in the Board of Improvements of Havana are strongly opposed to it, on the ground that it is nothing more than a legal revival of the slave trade, and will then still further to increase the numerical preponderance of the negroes, and involve a great future danger for society in Cuba. The plan is simply an offshoot of the old abolitionist measure of replacing negro slaves with Indian coolies, which has since relapsed into the present profitable practice of importing Chinese apprentices to the sugar growing fields of the tropics. 
Senor Menna’s plan is combined with great skill, and would effectually displace the slave trade on the coast of Africa, if adopted. The island of Fernando Po is situated in the Gulf of Guinea, about thirty miles from Calabar-the great sent of the slave trade in former times. Calabar is one of the many mouths of the river Niger, and possesses many advantages for keeping up the supply of voluntary apprentices after all the inhabitants of Fernando Po shall have been transported. This plan is now under consideration by the spanish government, and it is argued that its adoption will materially reduce the price of negroes in Cuba.
