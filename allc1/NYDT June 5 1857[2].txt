	The Common Law of England makes a part of the Constitution of all the original thir-teen States of this Union, and with barely an exception or two, of those since added; and this law is in part recognized by the Fed-eral Constitution and forms in part the basis of the law administered by the Supreme Court of the Uni-ted States. Now, it is well established that Christi-anity forms a part of the law of England; and on the basis of this doctrine, the testimony of no man not a Christian, could be received in any com-mon law court. This exclusion has been slightly modified, through the necessities of commerce, in behalf of Jews, Mohammedaus, &c., but it still re-mains the law that, in order to be sworn, as a pre-liminary to testifying, a man must be of some reli-gion, and must believe in a future state of rewards and punishments. The great spread of neological opinions in New-England—that source of so many isms—has led indeed to some still further recent modification in the law of those States; but, with these exceptions, the law throughout this Union—and when the Federal Constitution was adopted this was universally the case—deprives deists, universalists, and without any exception , atheists, of the right to testify in any court. Now, of all the disa-bilities which the laws of many of the States im-pose upon free negroes, there is none more expres-sive of distrust, antipathy, and an assumed destitu-tion of the qualities necessary in a citizen, than the laws which exclude their testimony. That testi-mony, however, is only excluded as against white men; in cases where only colored men are con-cerned, the courts will still listen to them; whereas, the other class of persons to whom we have refer-red are absolutely excluded from testifying at all, even against a negro!
