Brooklyn Jurors and Police

January 21st, 1857

	We find the following paragraph in a New York paper:
	"We learn that the Brooklyn people are taking measures to secure a re-organization of their Police Department, and for the selection of Jurors.  Bills for both these objects have been drawn by Judge Culver and sent to Albany.  The Police Commissioners, three in number, are to be appointed by the Governor and Senate, and the Commissioner of Jurors by the President of the Common Council, the City Judge, and the City Auditor.  They are to be forthwith presented to the Legislature."
	In the abscence of our Albany correspondence, which has been intercepted by the storm, we cannot say how correct this statement may be.-- The case of Alderman OLIVER was to have been argued before the City Court yesterday, but the "Court" was in Albany, very probably, with its two bills.  The fact of CULVER having drawn up bills for presentation to the Legislature, is prima facie evidence that the proper treatment to give them is to kick them out of doors.  There is not a human being in Kings County who looks upon CULVER with any feeling of confidence ; he is universally and justly regarded as a creature whose natural path of duty is to crawl through the crooked, slimy labyrinths of politics, and to do such dirty work as nobody else can stoop to.
