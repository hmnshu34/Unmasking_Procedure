Territorial Expansion-Its Commercial Character and Results. Tuesday, January 6th, 1857. Territorial Expansion is undoubtedly the characteristic movement of the age. Everywhere we see it rife. In America, New Mexico, California and Arizona are its signs. In Africa, we have France extending the boundaries of Algeria, and Great Britain shoving the limits of the Cape Colony northward. In Asia, Russia has eaten China out of the Amoor river, and has now got a foothold much farther south at Chusan: while England is declaring war against Persia, and talking of a military demonstration in Southern China. It even exists in crowded Europe, not to mention the Bessarabian provinces. The Zolverein of Germany is the same thing. This ,movement, in fact, is the true key to the whole policy of territorial extension. In the feudal ages territorial extension meant the spread of some monarch’s sway. In the present, when, to use a trite phrase, commerce is king, it is nothing more than the extension of trade without the bars of tariffs and custom houses. In short, it is the extension of free trade; and each commercial center of the world is endeavouring to increase its markets. This is the case with the United States, England, France and Russia.
The effect of the success of this policy upon the several centres from which each movement emanates, can be studied in our midst, though perhaps the results here have been somewhat greater than in Europe. Since the acquisition of California and New Mexico the commerce of the United States has nearly doubled, while the completed railways are more than twice the number of miles that they were eighty years ago. Though much of this increase has been owing to the natural law of our progress, yet a very large portion of it is due to the stimulus it recieved from the application of Anglo-Saxon energy and enterprise to elements that had lain for three centuries dormant around us.
