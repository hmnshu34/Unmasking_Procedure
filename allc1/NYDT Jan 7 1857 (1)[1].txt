	If such is to be the result, it is highly desireable that, if the public gains nothing pecunisrily, it should at least gain as much as possible in some other direction. If the Members of Congress are determined still to distribute among them the amount now paid in the name of travel, and perhaps to increase it, let them make an appropriation of the money most likely at once to benefit and to satisfy the public. If an appropriation can be hit upon which, while it benefits and gratifies the public as being likely to increase the respectability and efficiency of the Members of Congress, will at the same time operate to shield them per-sonally against many of the discomforts and dan-gers of Washington life, so much the better. 
	Suppose that the money now paid out for trav-eling fees were distributed among all the Members equally, not in the name of travel, but in that of family expense, only to be payable on condition that the Member receiving it brought with him to Washington at least a wife or a grown-up daugh-ter. It strikes us that if so much money in addi tion to the annual salary as now goes out of the Treasury on the absurd pretext of traveling ex-penses, is to be distributed among the members, it would be distributed among the Members, it would be difficult to hit on a more bemeficial or satisfactory appropriation of it than that above proposed. The separation of the Members from their families is well known to expose them to many very perilous temptations. Domestic life and female society are among the greatest deficiencies at Washington. The female visitors who are drawn thither under the present arrangements afford afford for the better part of the sex but a very inadequate representation. As to the nachelors and indowers, to avoid any objection of their part they might be allowed to compromise--the bachelors by bringing a grandmother, a mother, an aunt or a sister, for whom the widowers might be allowed to substitute a niece or a daughter-in-law.
