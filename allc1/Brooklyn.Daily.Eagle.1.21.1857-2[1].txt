	Since his elevation to the bench of the City Court, the character of that establishment has become a reflex of the character of the incumbent.  Its machinery has been prostituted to the basest uses: instead of feeling the dignity of the position, he dragged it down to his own level ; like the perfumed porcine quadruped who would return to her wallowing in the mire, no matter how thoroughly scrubbed and curried.
	"In spite of ablution, scent and perfume, pollution
	Showed still that the sow was a swine, sirs."
	We expect to have a law passed which will take the police away from politics entirely; but not a law to give the Governor and the Senate the appointing of three pliable, party politicians, who would make the police force a Black Republican machine.  Mr. Culver's bills will receive very unceremonious treatment in the Legislature, or we are very much mistaken.
