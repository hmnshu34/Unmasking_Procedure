	At length, a new Legislature has passed another, more moderate and less consistent act, tending to limit rather than prevent the sale of Intoxicating Liquors--to keep the traffic out of the worst hands now dabbling in it, and dismiss seven-eigths of the present rumsellers to more laudable and useful employments. Had Fernando Wood been asked, in 1855, to indicate the kind of Liqour Law that he would reccomend, he would doubtless have out-lined one essentially like this. Yet see how he berates it in his Message abusive of the Legislature: "This is another of the encroachments upon indi-vidual rights for which the dominant party are so much distinguished. It will probably be as fruit-less in the prevention of intemperance as it is an-tagonistic to the theory that should govern all American laws. The distinction that it makes be-tween the selling of liquor by the rich man and by the poor man, in affording facilities for the trade of the former which it denies to the latter, is con-sistent with the dogmas of a party which has always acknowledged the possession of property as a proof of merit. Under this ancient tenet of its leaders, crime and immorality are to be tolerated if the perpetrator belongs to the privileged classes, but to be severely punished when discovered in one who is lowly born. Under the bill, a man who can number twenty free-holders among its immediate friends and neighbors, shall be allowed to sell the destroying element which, according to these gentlemen, deals death and desruc-tion to all who partake of it; but the unfortunate poor man, whose condition deprives him of this support, is denied the privilege of transacting a legitimate trade, recognized and indorsed by law. Bythis condition a class of monopolists is to be established, whose merit lies in property and rich friends, while the equally honest and worthy are to be shut out from any participation in the same traffic. The original Stamp Act of the British Gov-ernmant, so indignantly repudiated by our forefathers, was far less exacting."
