	The idea of the depreciation of Spanish coin is very much exaggerated. There is a constant de-mand for it for the South American and Cuban trade, and some houses are now buying it at par, and quarters are purchased very freely at 23 cents. Rather than submit to a "shave," we should cer-tainly advise people to take a little trouble and carry their smooth sixpence and shillings to the best market. It has been suggested that this coin might be bought at the Mint by weight, at its real value; that Government should offer to buy it up for a certain period, and take some little pains to let the people know that it is thus ready. In six months, if such a policy was steadily pursued, we honestly believe that all this nuissance of sixpences and shillings would disappear from general circu-lation.
