	Had there been any doubt about the eligibility of Mr. OLIVER, the way to test it would have been by a quo warranto, that his right might be investigated ; but it remained for the individual who occupies the City Court to visit upon Ald. OLIVER all the disabilities which could arise if he had no right at all, and was found guilty of being an illegal intruder.  Hang a man and try him afterwards is the motto that guides CULVER.
	We care nothing about the miserable offices dispensed last night.  We look with contempt on the scrambling of place beggars; but we regret to see a body to whom the interests of the city are committed prove themselves so unworthy of their trust.  If men will use such means, and resort to such base instrumentalities to give offices to a few purchased retainers, can we hope that business of the public will be honestly or honorably transacted?  There are questions to come before the Board involving millions of dollars, and involving the very life-blood of the city.  Can we hope that they will not be sacrificed to hungry and calamorous spoilsmen?  We will hope for the best ; but our aspirations will be much less sanguine when we recollect the proceedings of last night.
	We were misinformed yesterday in stating that Messrs. KING and WARING had sought the injunction against Mr. OLIVER.  They had nothing to do with it.
