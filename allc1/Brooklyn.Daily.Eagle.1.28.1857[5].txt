	The fact is we live under a Republican form of government.  The Federal and State Constitutions proceed upon the assumption that the people are competent, and have the right to elect their own rulers and make their own laws.  And in all the cities, towns and villages in the State, the entire control of the people thereof over their own local affairs, is expressly reserved and guaranteed to them.
