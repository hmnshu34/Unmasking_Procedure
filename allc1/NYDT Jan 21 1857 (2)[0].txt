	The Cologue Gazette states, in a recent article, that the Japanese Government have arranged with the Butch for the construction in Holland of four steam screw corvettes, to be sent out to Japan in the course of the present year under the command of a Dutch officer, and that means have been pro-vided for this purpose to the extent of two and a half million dollars. It further states that the Japanese Government have requested four Dutch naval officers to remain in Japan for the purpose of instructing the Japanese in naval affairs, and that it has taken into its service a number of Dutch mariners of various grades to qualify the Japanese mariners for active service. 
	It appears from the published statements of Tit-singh, who was Director of the Dutch Factory in 1779-80, and again in 1781-83, and for a third time in 1784, that as long ago as his time there existed in Japan a party among the nobles and princes fav-orable to the adopiton of foreign improvements, and in particular to the building of ships and junks suit-able for foreign voyages. This party of improve-ment was headed at that time by Tonoma, a young man of uncommon abilities, a Counselor of State--whose father was an uncle of the reigning Siogun, and one of his chief advisers. The members of this party stigmatized theis opponents, the Tories or old fogies of Japan, by the expressive and signifi-cant appellation of Inodzi-no-Kaform-- that is, Fregs-in-a-well--and they expected that when Tonoma should succeed to the place of his father--all offices in Japan being hereditary--he would, as they expressed it, "widen the road."
