The New Liquer Law--Lager Bier Triumphant

April 22nd, 1857

	We have heard some intimation of a design on the part of those affected by the new License Law to contest it in the Courts.  A perusal of the Act ought to satisfy them that it is unnecessary.  In the first place the Board of Excise may license every grocery in the city and every "store-keeper" to retail liquors, for a moderate license, so long as it is not drank on the premises.  No petition is needed, except a mere application of the person desiring the license.  The stores may be located in the same neighborhood as closely as the "four-and-twenty blackbirds," all in a row, which were set before the king, as celebrated in nursery rhyme.  Insatiate drinkers, will this not suffice?
	In the second place the sale of beer, ale, porter and all malt liquors, is left as free as the traffic in lucifer matches and boot laces.  It will be observed that, all through the bill, any interferance with the unrestricted sale of these liquors is carefully avoided, the penalties enumerated art confined to the unlicensed sale of "strong and spitituous liquors and wines," and not merely by an oversight but by an intentional discrimination.  No reference to ales, old or new beer, strong or weak, is made in the bill from beginning to end.  The intention probably is to wean people from the use of the strong liquors by encouraging the sale of malt drinks.  But as the fiery compound may be retailed by all store keepers, this partiality for lager bier will be without effect.  In procuring a tavern license it is necessary to show that tavern accommodation is required in the neighborhood, but no such necessity exists in the matter of securing a license to retail liquor by store keepers.  The law is as liberal in favor of the worst class of grogshops as the most vulcanised rum-snout could desire.
