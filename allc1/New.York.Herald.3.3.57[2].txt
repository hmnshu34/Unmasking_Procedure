The public expects and should receive from the press fair and unbiased reports of every matter of general interest. The public amusements of a great city are matters of general interest. If the public has reason to believe that the criticisms upon plays and players are dictated by influences apart from truth, candor and fairness to all parties, the public then must lose all confidence in the journals. It appears, from the testimony of the Hon. Booby Brooks, who occupies the position of Stateâ€™s evidence, and of Mrs. McMahon, who says she has been a victim, that there is reason to believe that some outside influences have been brought to bear upon the socalled theatrical criticisms. It is important that these matters should be properly investigated. Let us have a committee, and let every poor actor, actress, singer or manager be summoned to tell whether they have been paid anything for good notices, how much they have paid, in what way it was paid, and to whom it was paid. We must have all these matters cleared up. Perhaps the great libel case-critic against manager-will do it. If not, let us have the investigating committee.
