	Taking the new cabinet as announced in the papers to be correct, MR. BUCHANAN sets out with the determination to be guided by the conservative sentiment, which preponderates in both sections of the Union and to afford no aid or comfort to the sectionalists and fanatics of of either north or south.  Of course whatever the government may do will be misrepresented and denounced by consistent partisans like the New York Tribune, which dare not censure its political friends, and partners in corruption, but shields them as far as in its power ; while its abuse of political opponents never ceases.
	But the people at large will judge of the government by its acts, and those who opposed the election of MR. BUCHANAN on consicientious grounds will be glad to see the fears they entertained in case of his election proved groundless.  An organised opposition of politicians whose trade is to traduce others to promote their own success, will, of course be kept up; but the operations of those brallers in philanthropy and have been sufficiently exposed recently to render their designs harmless for sometime to come.
