Walker is by no means without his allies, and they are allies of the most efficient kind-the allies which Kossuth pleaded for so powerfully in behalf of Hungary-the allies “material and financial aid.” He has them in Valparaiso, in Peru, in San Francisco, in Mexico, in New Orleans, Philadelphia and New York; and if they have heretofore furnished him resources to the extent of a million of money, they will not be wanting to the extent of another million or two, as long as he holds his ground. His project is theirs, and comprehends something more than the monopoly of the “fares and ferriage” of the Transit route. It involves the grand scheme of the reduction and reconstruction of the whole of Central America upon an Anglo-Saxon platform, and upon “commercial and military principles.”
This plan embodies, also, the Southern idea of the practical establishment of African slavery in Central America, and the development through this medium of the capabilities of those fertile tropical regions as cotton, sugar, chocolate, tobacco and indigo producing States. Let the North American political programme of Walker be established over Central America, and slaveholders from our Southern States, with their slaves, will soon out the ball of slave labor in motion. The African slave trade, in the next place, will soon fill up all deficiencies between the law of demand and supply in the article of niggers. This the British West India policy of emancipation as a stepping stone to the abolition of slavery in our Southern States will be met by a counter movement of the South of the most formidable character.
