The Board of Alderman

March 3rd, 1857

	Mr. S. also presented a memorial, signed by John A. Cross and others, in favor of reducing the number of Aldermen in your city to one from each ward.  Also that the Sessions of the Board shall commence at 2 P.M., and the members who shall be present at the Session shall be entitled to the sum of $2.  Also in favor of the election of all city officers at Spring Elections.
	In the House last evening Mr. Hanford introduced a bill to authorise the laying out of parks, public high places and markets in Brooklyn.  This bill I think is an old acquaintance, and was up last year.  It is a proposition, as near as I can understand, to bring into market a quantity of low land in Williamsburgh, which is not of ready sale.  I do not think the measure can succeed.
	Mr. Funk introduced a bill in relation to taxes and assessments in Brooklyn, which defines more explicitly the present law.
	This morning, after the reception of reports upon various private and local bills, the House proceeded to consider the special order, being the bill proposing a removal of Quarantine.  A spirited debate ensued, as there is a counter proposition fearing to establish a branch quarantine at Sandy Hook.
	There appears to be considerable feeling regarding this matter--the people of New York--principally business men, have interested themselves largely in it.  At first they petitioned for a removal of Quarantine, but recently they have changed their minds and have gone in for the establishment of the branch proposed.
