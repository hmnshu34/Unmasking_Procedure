		The first objection to this scheme is, that it comes into open and direct 	conflict with the following provisions of the State Constitution :--
		Art. X., 2. All city, town, and village officers, whose election or appointment 	is not provided for by this Constitution, shall be elected by the elctors of such 	cities, towns and villages, or appointed by such authorities thereof as the legislature 	shall designate for that purpose.  All other officers whose election or appointment is 	not provided for by this Constitution, and all other officers whose office may 	hereafter be created by the law, shall be elected by the people or appointed as the 	Legislature may direct.
	The "other officers" twice spoken of in the last clause of this section, are evidently officers other than the "city, town and village officers" referred to in the firt.  These latter are expressly excepted from the operation of the last clause.-- They must, under all circumstances, be elected by the electors, or appointed by the authorities, of the cities, towns and villages in which their functions are to be exercised.  The Board of Commissioners which the Courier and Enquirer proposes, clearly fall under the category of "City officers"--and to vest their appointment in the Governor and Senate, or in the Legislature, or in any power outside the City, is a thing which cannot be done.  The State Constitution forbids it.
