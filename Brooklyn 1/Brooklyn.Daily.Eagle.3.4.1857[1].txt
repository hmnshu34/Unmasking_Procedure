	In the House, this being General Order Day, various bills on the Calendar were taken up.-- The bill to provide for the removal of Quarantine came up again, when Mr. B. Owen moved an amendment providing for a floating hospital to be located at Sandy Hook--that the five commissioners shall then examine and select a site for a permanent Quarantine, and shall report such selection to the Governor, Lieut. Governor, and President of the New York Chamber of Commerce ; and in case they shall approve of such selection, then the Quarantine bill be removed.  The sum of $50,000 is appropriated to defray the immediate expense of the experiment.
	There was no final action had on the bill, or the amendment, and the House adjourned.
