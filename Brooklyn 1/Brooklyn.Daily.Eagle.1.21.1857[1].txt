	We are sorry that the Association has given way even so far as to pass any resolutions upon the subject.  We think it was not called for or incumbent upon it to take a single step in the matter ; but now that it is done, let the matter rest.  It is very evident that the only way to preserve the existence of the Association is to exclude this everlasting niggerism.  If the Association is to be converted into a political last to drive its members to the polls by the understrappers of the Independent, of course it will soon be exploded into as many fragments as it contains members.
