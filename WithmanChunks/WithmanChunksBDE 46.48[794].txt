35    choice fancy articles. Among the pieces lately published by Mr. H. are the following: Jenny Lind’s Song of Fatherland—a soft and sweet melody, full of the beauty which
is said to characterise everything sung by that famous songstress.
The  Mariner,  a  favorite  song  also  of  the  ‘‘Swedish  nightingale.’’  We  are  no
connoisseur, but this song too, seems to embody some of the best elements of music.
40	The Diamond Glee-book, a collection of seven glees: the Woods, by Mendelssohn—
Maid of Langollen—While the moon shines bright—Orpheus with his lute—On the
sea—War song—and Happy hearts. These are neatly stitched in a cover, and sold for
37 1⁄2     cents—both good and cheap.
Broadway Polka, composed by Wm. H. Bruhns: said by a musical friend to ‘taste
45    well’ when played on the piano forte.
University quickstep, by L. Cleim; quite a dashing piece.
These pieces are all published by Mr. Holt,—and besides, he has everything that

the other music houses issue, or have issued. He is a Brooklyn man, and should be patronized by Brooklyn folk.
