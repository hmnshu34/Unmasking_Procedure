throughout the year. It is printed in handsome style, well bound, and must of course be
highly serviceable to those connected with the episcopal denomination. The use of
such works as this, properly considered, is by no means confined to offices of formal
devotion. The Lessons could well be made a book for family companionship—the
eternal and unequalled wisdom which is upon their pages, is fit for all conditions of  15
men, and appropriate at all times, and under all circumstances. (For sale at Wilder ’s
book-stores, in Brooklyn.)
‘‘Anecdotes for girls,’’ is the mate of another book ‘‘for boys,’’ issued by Gould,
Kendall & Lincoln, 59 Washington street, Boston. It contains the right sort of reading to
seize and hold the attention of youth—short stories, and anecdotes, embodying their  20
morals not in dry advice, but in the spirit of the incident related. We like these little
works well, and hope our parent readers will procure them for their young people.
(For sale by Colby, Nassau street, New York, and the booksellers, generally.)
Part 58 of Virtue’s Devotional Family Bible, (London issue—New York agency, 26
John st.,) contains a very well executed line engraving of ‘the finding of Moses.’ This  25
work is printed in the handsomest manner—and is steadily approaching completion.
