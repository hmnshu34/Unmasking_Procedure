there  is  also  such  a  thing  as  false  scurrility. . . . . . . . .  Our  venerable  friend  then propels in this wise, after magnanimously declining to draw our portrait:

    ‘‘This hectoring scrivener had better keep himself behind his smoky paragraphs,  which regularly throw his democratic friends into convulsions, and which have already done vast ser- vice to the whig cause. We would not for the world unseat him!’’	5

    Which is very kind indeed, considering how easily you could do it, Mr. Star. Moreover, ‘‘hectoring scrivener ’’ is good; but it ain’t so good as ‘‘smoky paragraphs.’’ The Star rejoices that it is ‘‘able to amuse.’’ All we have to say, then, is that it has cause for exceeding great joy: a more ridiculous paper is not printed in Yankeedom. We
should not volunteer this opinion; but, being provoked, and having a judgement  10
drawn from us, we may as well state the fact.
The Star copied our local reports, and being gently reminded thereof thought fit to
give us some of its impudence. Having thus sharply exposed its meanness, instead of
confessing its error, it now comes to abuse us personally—which is all the thanks we
get, after supplying it with the most valuable portion of its local reading! Naughty Star,  15
is this your decorum and dignity?
