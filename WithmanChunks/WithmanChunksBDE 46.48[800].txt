and the Tribune, there is in this thing only one side, and that altogether against us.
We approach the close of these remarks with a question of the Tribune’s own
asking: ‘‘Are the people, [and government] of the United States, absolute beasts?’’ If
half of what Mr. Clay and the Tribune says, about the country’s action in the Mexican
disputes,  is  true,  they  are.  If  they  are  not,  can  we  be  charged  with  grossness  in  10
intimating that the character in the interrogatory would, at least, be more appropriate
on their maligners?
In conclusion, we are sorry to utter a word which has the least appearance of
disrespect toward such a man as Mr. Gallatin. We are fain to think that age has dulled
the clearness of his mind, and bereft his former patriotism of its fair proportions; and  15
yet we are astonished that it is so! But having come out in the way he has, our duty to
our country, and the convictions of our conscience, would not hold us guiltless in
saying less than we have said.

Shall We Have That Monument?


    It is unnecessary, in giving the detailed proceedings which follow, for us again to  25 go over the ground of the arguments in favor of the proposed monument to the American prisoners who died, during ‘‘the days that tried men’s souls,’’ in the British hulks, at the Wallabout. We publish the proceedings, in all their length and breadth, because we not only feel warmly in favor of the monument, but think that a united and energetic effort on the part of the citizens to whom it is left, will now secure it. The  30 resolutions themselves express the reasons and facts, connected with the movement, quite fully: we call particular attention to them.
